Task 7: Monitoring and Updates
Monitoring: we can monitor this solution by tracking key metrics such as:

Latency and throughput: we can Use monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to visualize response times and throughput.
Model accuracy: Periodically retrain and test the model on new data to ensure accuracy.
Updates:

Retrain the model when new data is available or when performance on key metrics degrades.
we can Monitor API usage and respond to performance or scalability issues.
