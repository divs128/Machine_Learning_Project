Your Fitbit Could Help You Get Pregnant — Here’s How,0,"The story focuses on how wearable technology — particularly the Fitbit — could help women track their ovulation cycle in order to increase the odds of becoming pregnant. The story does, briefly, address the fact that this will not help women who have other medical obstacles to becoming pregnant, but could have done more to address (even in brief) meaningful issues related to infertility. Similarly, while the story mentions the small sample size of the relevant study, it doesn’t stress that a study involving only five people is statistically not significant. Choosing to have a child is among the most important and personal decisions that a woman can make, and subsequent difficulties with conceiving can cause significant emotional distress. And these difficulties are not uncommon. According to the National Institutes of Health, “Studies suggest that after 1 year of having unprotected sex, 15% of couples are unable to conceive, and after 2 years, 10% of couples still have not had a successful pregnancy.” Many factors can contribute to fertility problems — in both women and men. Technology may prove to be an effective tool for helping women track their ovulation cycles, but the study discussed here is far too small to make any significant claims — and would still not be a guarantee that it will help many women become pregnant."
Study: Gene therapy improves Parkinson’s symptoms,1,"Room for improvement:  Some discussion of costs. While the gene therapy is in the early stages of development and a price is not likely available at the moment, the cost of other non-drug treatments could have been included. There were some critical gaps in the evaluation of the evidence and the reporting was not entirely accurate. More complete discussion of harms. Medication can be very effective for reducing the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, especially in the first few years after onset. However, Parkinson’s is a progressive disorder that can eventually cause significant disability in a significant number of sufferers. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used for almost two decades for people who no longer benefit from drug therapy. Although DBS provides relief of symptoms for many, it is not a panacea. The kind of experimental gene therapy discussed in this story could eventually provide another option to help patients manage their symptoms."

A crystal ball for the spine,0,"Is the ScoliScore genetic test of scoliosis progression risk a “tremendous advance forward,” as the company researcher quoted in this story claims, or is it “investigational” and in need of further study, as some major insurance companies have determined? Readers of this story get only the company line and none of the independent evaluation.They aren’t told about the test’s $3000 price tag. They aren’t told that the test has not been evaluated by the FDA or any other regulatory body. They are given the impression that it may be useful for a larger number of people than even the test’s maker recommends. They see the test portrayed as superior to alternatives when no such comparisons have been performed. They aren’t told that the spine specialist quoted in the story has disclosed elsewhere that he owns stock in the company. They are treated to a glowing report from a single patient (who has also been the only patient featured in other stories.) Scoliosis is common in adolescents, but for most it is mild and does not worsen as they grow. For some, the amount of curvature is greater and the question of whether it is going to worsen or not over time becomes clinically relevant. This is the population in which this test could be considered. The question is whether this test can improve the predictive ability of the doctor in a way that improves the process and outcomes of care compared to usual practice. One issue is whether this test may identify individuals at low risk for progression who may not need to be followed as closely and may not need a brace. The outcomes are the number of xrays, visits and braces avoided and the improved quality of life that results compared to usual care. The bigger issue is a very small percent of individuals with scoliosis go on to requiring surgery. Though not addressed, a test that could identify individuals early for intervention and prevent that would be a real step forward and one that could justify the cost of this test. However, no evidence is presented that the test could do this."

Cancer drug may elude many women who need it,1,"""This is a story about two presentations at the The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting about evidence questioning the accuracy of tumor testing to determine which women qualify for treatment with trastuzumab (trade name Herceptin). Tumor profiling has been hailed as a new era in individualized cancer treatment, but reports from ASCO demonstrate the imperfect nature of the current science, either in the ability to consistently provide accurate results, or in the validity of the assumptions made in the tightness of the linkage between diagnostics, drugs and effectiveness tests. The story lists some of the problems of inconsistent cutoff values for testing, but only provides limited quantitative evidence. The story mentions trastuzumab as a promising drug in the arsenal of breast cancer treatments; however, the story does not mention that trastuzumab is given along with chemotherapy. We are also not told that women take trastuzumab by infusion (IV) for up to a year. This may be play into the cost/benefit decision making process of whether to retest formerly Her2/neu negative women, or whether it makes sense for them to now take the drug, regardless of their status.

FDA Rejects Health Claim for Green Tea,1,"This article reported on the the FDA’s rejection of a petition to allow sellers of green tea to legally claim that it reduces the risk of heart disease. Although green tea has become more popular during the last decade, there is insufficient evidence to support the contention that green tea is beneficial in terms of heart disease risk. The article reported this in an unsensational fashion and also educated the reader about health claims. While reporting on the lack of evidence to support the contention that green tea provides cardiovascular benefit, this article missed the opportunity to mention evidence-based ways to reduce cardiovascular risk. It also did not inform the reader on potential harms of green tea consumption for some people (especially those with heart problems for whom caffeine consumption may be limited). The story said that spokespersons for the world’s largest green tea company and for the consulting group that filed the petition with the FDA did not respond to messages left for them. But there were no comments from individuals conducting research investigating whether green tea affects heart disease risk."
New study finds adult fresh pear consumers had a lower body weight than non-pear consumers,1,"This news release, issued by Edelman, a public relations firm, on behalf of the Pear Bureau Northwest, a pear marketing group, is a textbook example of how to conflate “correlation” with “cause and effect,” and confuse consumers all the way to the fruit aisle. The release describes results of an “analytic,” observational, data-mining study of some subset (readers never learn what subset, exactly) of pear-eating people among participants in the 2001-10 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey of adult Americans. The data suggested that people who reported eating pears had a “lower” body weight than non-pear eaters and were “35 percent less likely to be obese.”  From there it leaps to the idea that there are health benefits to eating a “pear a day,” attributing the benefits to the relatively high fiber content of the fruit. Although the release notes that the data suggest eating fresh pears “should be encouraged” as part of an “overall healthy diet;” and the lead investigator acknowledges in a quote that this is an “association” or “correlational” study, the body of the release offers no data to support the notion that pears are more likely than any other fiber source or food to actually reduce weight or obesity. It offers no information (as did the study, published in the journal Nutrition and Food Science) about the participants or the strengths/weaknesses of the correlation. And above all it fails to note that those who reported eating pears were older and seemed to be more health-conscious — they drank less alcohol and smoked less — all of which could have contributed to or even accounted for the lower body weight and lower risk of obesity. Most of the release is a predictable promotional piece for the wonders of Barletts and Boscs, noting of course that they are “cholesterol-free,” “fat-free” and potassium-rich. The release is likely to have some readers believing that pears potentially play a key role in stopping the obesity epidemic; oh, that it were so. Predictably, a couple of online news articles got the (wrong) message, including this one: “A Pear a Day Keeps the Pounds Away” (UK’s Daily Mail). Consumers already have a big problem figuring out healthy diets and healthy weight loss programs. The hope is that the agricultural marketing industry will help educate consumers, not mislead them."

New treatment seen for back-pain relief,0,"This story reports on the experience of one physician, the owner of a spine center, in performing spinal decompression therapy for herniated disc. The claims of very high recovery rates at reduced cost allowing patients to avoid invasive surgery are very appealing. However, this story is flawed in many ways. The story only quotes one physician, the owner of a center that provides spinal decompression. This is a major flaw in the story. The story should have quoted other clinicians or researchers to provide some context for the claims being made. The story quantifies the benefits of treatment in relative terms only. Also, the story does not compare the effectiveness of spinal decompression to other alternatives. The story says that “research has shown 86 to 94% success rate with decompression.” Compared to what? Most people with back pain find that the pain resolves on its own or with minimal intervention. Furthermore, the story does not explain the strength of the available evidence, which is not very strong. The story does not provide adequate information on the novelty of decompression, on potential harms of the treatment, or on the advantages and disadvantages of the treatment compared to the alternative options. Although the story does explain that this treatment is available and claims that the treatment is common on the West Coast but not in the Midwest, this is not sufficient information on availability. By describing a patient who “came crawling into my practice,” the story crosses the line into disease mongering. This case represents an extreme example of herniated disc. Many patients are not as bothered by symptoms. The story also starts out by saying that this is a new treatment for herniated discs, but later claims that it can be used to treat a wide variety of back pain conditions. The story also does not explain that this treatment should not be used in people who have had back pain for less than a few months, for whom exercise and time would be the best course of treatment. The story does mention the cost of the treatment, which is not covered by insurance. The story should have compared the cost to other available treatments."

Taking Fish Oil During Pregnancy Is Found to Lower Child’s Asthma Risk,2,"This New York Times story looks at a new study showing a reduced risk of asthma in the children of mothers who took high doses of fish oil during the last trimester of pregnancy. The story was strong–it did a lot of things well. We were especially pleased to see the Times use both absolute and relative risk numbers when conveying the measured benefit. We learn, for example, that fish oil reduced the risk of asthma 31 percent, the relative risk benefit. That is tempered by inclusion of the absolute risk reduction–16.9% of mothers who supplemented had children with asthma, compared to 23.7 of mothers taking a placebo. This helps readers keep expectations in check. The main shortcoming is the story’s failure to disclose relevant conflicts of interest. One of the researchers has a financial interest in the genetic testing he advocates in the story — and readers should be aware of that interest as they consider his recommendations. Other than avoidance of smoking by the mother, there is currently no known way to prevent asthma from developing in a child, and the World Health Organization defines its global health and economic impact as “severe.” Given how common this disease is, news coverage on this study will be highly read, making it vital to distill the results accurately. This story did so, and provided important context to let parents know that researchers aren’t yet ready to recommend high-dose fish oil supplementation to pregnant women."

Anti-inflammatory drugs might someday treat depression,1,"CNN’s story about the potential future use of a type of anti-inflammatory drug to treat depression is based largely on research described in a news release issued by the University of Cambridge. The story accurately reports serious interest by the principal investigator of the new research, and others, in tantalizing links between the immune system’s responsive  inflammatory chemicals–cytokines–and mental illness. In this case, the investigators accumulated evidence for the potential value of anti-cytokine therapy by focusing on anti-depressant effects of the drugs reported as side effects in a meta-analysis of 7 substantial clinical studies, mostly involving those with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. The story quotes the principal investigator’s explanation for those links. But unlike the study and the news release (which we also reviewed), it waits until the last two sentences to point out that the antidepressant effects of anti-cytokine drugs are at best “mild,” and essentially fails to point out that even if the new drugs were eventually proven safe and effective for depression, it’s likely that only a small subset of depressed people–those with chronic inflammation and resistant to current antidepressants–would find benefit over and above what other treatments already offer. It’s worth noting that the news release did a better job of pointing out the limitations and side effects of any use of anti-cytokines in the future; and of making clear that randomized clinical trials are needed even to get near the point of using the drugs. Neither the news release nor the story, though, talked about the cost of this relatively new class of anti-inflammatories, some of which which are currently heavily advertised, but used to treat only severe cases of autoimmune disorders. Depression is a major worldwide disability that often goes undiagnosed or untreated. The National Institute of Mental Health estimates worldwide prevalence at 3.7 percent of adults and some estimates put the U.S. adult prevalence for major depressive illness as high as 7 percent. The costs in disability, lost productivity, and treatment are staggering; access to therapists is increasingly difficult. First-line drug therapies are often effective, but for many with chronic depression, don’t work. As a result, news about new classes of drugs or combinations of drugs to treat depression, brings huge audiences, and good coverage of such news must reflect practical realities and limitations."

"Special CT scans cut lung cancer deaths in major study, but questions remain about screening",2,"It’s clear that this story worked very hard to avoid hyping the results of the National Lung Screening Trial, which found that heavy smokers who were offered certain CT scans were less likely to die of lung cancer than those who were offered chest x-rays. It quickly puts the relative difference in death rates (20 percent) into context with the actual numbers (354 vs. 442 deaths among 53,500 participants). Near the top, this story tells readers of doubts about the balance of harms and benefits of this type of screening. It emphasizes that quitting smoking is the best way to avoid lung cancer death. However, it appears that the story is mostly based on material handed out by the National Cancer Institute, which sponsored the trial. It fails to give readers any independent perspectives on the trial or the meaning of its results. Even a call to the American Cancer Society would have provided a cautious viewpoint. (Please note: later versions of AP stories carried independent perspectives but we reviewed the first version we found.) News reports on medical trials must give readers a balanced perspective. But journalists should seek out independent sources, so that they are not dependent on the sponsor or lead researcher to provide that balance."

No significant difference in pain relief for opioids vs. non-opioid analgesics for treating arm or leg pain,1,"The release focuses on a recent study, published in JAMA, that evaluated the effectiveness of four painkillers in addressing acute arm or leg pain in emergency room patients. One of the painkillers was a combination of the over-the-counter medications acetaminophen and ibuprofen; the other three painkillers were combinations of acetaminophen and an opioid (oxycodone, hydrocodone or codeine). The study found that — within the two-hour window being evaluated — there was no statistical significant difference in the effectiveness of the four drugs, indicating that acetaminophen/ibuprofen is a viable alternative to opioids for addressing acute pain. The release does a good job of describing the study and placing it in the context of the “opioid crisis” in the U.S. However, the release does not address cost or potential harms, and does not make clear how this study builds on or differs from previous research on how non-opioid painkillers differ from opioid painkillers. As the news release notes, “the United States is facing an opioid epidemic.” According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, at least 2 million Americans had an addiction to prescription painkillers in 2015 — and more than 20,000 people died from prescription painkiller overdoses in the same year. And data from the National Institute of Drug Abuse show that this problem is on the rise. In other words, the subject matter is timely and important. But patients and healthcare providers also deserve a little additional context for this work. Is this the first study to compare non-opioid and opioid painkillers? The release doesn’t tell us. (It’s not.) How do they compare on cost? Is the non-opioid option risk free? These are important questions, and ones that could be addressed quickly. The release would have been stronger if it had done so. An editorial in JAMA editorial notes that the ibuprofen-acetaminophen combination has been studied and used more in other countries, and that many people get their first opioid prescription from the ER, so cutting down on opioid use and distribution from ERs could make a significant dent in the epidemic. This was a main reason for the study."

Stem cells may significantly improve tendon healing by regulating inflammation,0,"A basic study of the ability of stem cells to “regulate” inflammation in tendons seems promising enough to invite further research into the role stem cells might play in this important piece of body scaffolding. But examining stem cell activity in petri dishes and in rats does not get us within shouting distance of a treatment. The news release acknowledges the early stage of this work, but its headline heralds the study’s findings in ways that will encourage readers to anticipate help sooner rather than later. Injured tendons heal at an extremely slow pace, sidelining many people for months at a time. If inflammation is a major reason for this, then a treatment that addresses that problem would be of interest to active Americans and those who treat them. However, it’s premature to draw conclusions about the potential of treating inflamed tendons with stem cells based on this very preliminary work. Because of the rise in health news about stem cells we’ve written some tips for communicating stem cell research."

Doubts on Ovarian Cancer Relapse Test,2,"""CA-125 is the only existing blood test or tumor marker that is used for ovarian cancer follow-up. It measures a microscopic substance which is produced by the tumor and breaks off, circulating in the bloodstream. It is not elevated in every patient with ovarian cancer, and can be falsely elevated in people who have no diagnosis of cancer. That is why it is not very good for ovarian cancer screening. This story reports on new results showing that women who got regular CA-125 testing after treatment for ovarian cancer did not have better survival than women who got no testing. These results further call into question the utility of CA-125 for monitoring recurrent ovarian cancer. This story accurately describes the novelty, availability and harms of CA-125. It does not engage in disease mongering and does a good job of describing the current study and how it relates to current clinical thinking.

Barrow neurosurgeon helps pave way for deep brain stimulation and Alzheimer's,1,"Illustration: Deep brain stimulation electrode placement. WikipediaThis news release summarizes the results of a phase 2 safety trial of a deep brain stimulation device on patients with potential mild Alzheimer’s disease. This is an off-label trial of a device currently used to treat Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor. The device is an implanted neurostimulator that delivers electrical signals to specific areas of the brain, in this case, the fornix which is a memory pathway. The trial was intended to test the 90-day postoperative safety of this particular surgical method. We were disappointed to see that the news release reported only mild side effects and not the serious harms which required several of the study group patients to have corrective surgery. As the U.S. population ages, Alzheimer’s disease becomes more widespread. About 5 million Americans are currently living with Alzheimer’s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There is a need for more options to treat this disease as well as a need for greater understanding of how to prevent the disease, or stave it off until as late as possible.

FDA Approves Roche’s Cotellic Treatment for Melanoma,0,"This story reports on U.S. Food & Drug Administration approval of Cotellic in combination with vemurafenib to treat advanced melanoma, cancer that has spread throughout the body. The story adheres very closely to the FDA announcement and includes ample information on the side effects. However, the story does not convey the actual efficacy of this drug combination, stating only that that “The FDA said the safety and efficacy of Cotellic in combination with vemurafenib were shown in a clinical study of 495 patients.”  There is no indication of how well this drug combination works and it is also not made immediately clear that this drug combination works only for one genetic varient of melanoma, the BRAF V600 mutation. We think the most egregious problem with this story is that nothing at all is said about the cost of this drug. The combination is reportedly going to be priced at $17,600 per month. According to the FDA, melanoma is the most aggressive and dangerous form of skin cancer in the United States. The National Cancer Institute estimates that 73,870 Americans will be diagnosed with melanoma and 9,940 will die from the disease this year.

New therapy promising for skin cancer,1,"CNN afforded an unusual amount of time to this story about a National Cancer Institute study, published in the journal Science, about a gene therapy approach for advanced melanoma. But there were some critical pieces of information missing from the story, even with the amount of time afforded it. While this experimental approach is, of course, of interest, it is important to be mindful that the majority of individuals diagnosed with melanoma are successfully treated using conventional methods. The gene therapy approach was not effective for most patients studied. When the story projected possible effectiveness of this mode of treatment to other forms of cancer, it left the world of evidence and entered the sphere of pure speculation. The story didn’t discuss any side effects from the treatment and gave only cursory mention that the treatment was ineffective for the majority of patients involved in the trial (15 of 17 died). The story should have mentioned that because so few people have experienced this gene therapy approach, there is insufficient information about the potential harms. The only source of information used on the air was the principal investigator of the study. Inclusion of other clinicians involved with immunotherapy could have provided grounded estimates of the benefit and risks to patients. Other news media across the country offered such perspective on this story, offering a much more complete and balanced view. The story seemed particularly fawning, when the anchorman asked the principal investigator, “Do you need more money, more support, more help? Or do you have everything you need right now to see how far you can take this?” Other perspectives were needed to balance the story. There was also no estimate given for the cost of such a gene therapy approach, not even a projection of what it might cost. There was also no mention that it was tested in patients who had received other treatments both before and after the immunotherapy. This is an important issue. If these experiments lead to a new therapy, it would make all existing forms of treatment look inexpensive. This would be individualized treatment in its ultimate form."
"To Treat Depression, Try a Digital Therapist",2,"This story heralds the evolution of internet-based therapies for treating mild to moderate depression. It summarizes several recent studies, which find that a combination of interacting with both a “smart” internet app and human therapists competes well with more traditional, face-to-face strategies. The story hits a lot of the right notes, employing independent sources, making clear that efficacy studies are still relatively sparse, and giving readers access to actual study texts. Missing from the story is any mention of potential downsides of internet-based therapies, an omission that seems important given the traditional, highly interpersonal nature of cognitive behavioral therapy. Initial research suggests that internet-based approaches to therapy can work for individuals with minor or moderate mental health problems. If that good news continues to hold over the course of further studies, such a strategy would be a boon in areas of the world with few mental health resources."
Bacteria From Mother May Colonize Cesarean Births,2,"This is a well-articulated but incomplete story about a proof-of-principle study suggesting that when babies born by C-section are swabbed with their mother’s vaginal fluids, they have a microbiome more closely approximating those of their vaginally-born peers up to a month after birth. The article does a nice job of explaining the science and placing the evidence in context, but we think that it missed the mark on the potential harms of the intervention. This is a significant omission. Emerging research suggests that the types and patterns of natural bacteria growing on our bodies are important for healthy immune, digestive, and metabolic systems. Babies born by C-section do not have the benefit of being colonized by the natural bacteria in their mothers’ vaginal tracts, so an alternative method for inoculating babies with these bacteria (and an inexpensive, easy-to-implement one, at that) may even the playing field for C-section babies."

New guidelines urge every pregnant woman to get early testing for risk of Down syndrome,1,"""This story reports on a new American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendation that all pregnant women, regardless of their age, be offered screening for Down syndrome. This represents a departure from previous guidelines, which stated that only women 35 and older be offered testing. The new guidelines involve the use of less invasive techniques, a combination of a blood test and a new kind of ultrasound. This story does a good job of describing what is involved with the new screening and why it is being promoted, and featuring a woman who chose testing. However, the story lacks balance by not presenting the evidence to support the new screening, by not mentioning the potential harms, and by not quoting experts with differing views, or a woman who chose not to be tested. The story does state that the new recommendations represent a departure from existing guidelines and does state that the availability of the new ultrasound may be limited to academic or large city hospitals. The story also mentions amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling and the quadruple screen as alternatives. The story should have also pointed out that no screening remains a viable option. By accurately presenting the prevalence of Down syndrome, the story avoids disease mongering. Furthermore, the story does quote multiple experts, but the story should have quoted experts with differing opinions on the value of the new screening recommendations in order to provide some much needed perspective. However, the story does not describe the strength of the available evidence. The story states that the new screening protocol is much more accurate, but there is no evidence presented to support these claims. Furthermore, although the story does state the """"accuracy rate"""" for the new twofold screening protocol with and without the addition of the quadruple screen, there is no comparison to existing screenings such as amniocentesis. Furthermore, the more important information to give consumers would be the positive predictive value of the screening, or the probability of Down syndrome given a positive test result. This is especially important when the prevalence of Down is so low, causing most positive test results to be false positives. The story also does not mention potential harms of treatment, such as anxiety from positive test results and the possibility that patients will fail to follow up on a positive initial screen. The story also fails to define the potential harm of providing false reassurance – the risk of false negative results, which is failing to identify an affected infant, which would be of concern to women who are seeking accurate answers. Finally, although the story does mention the cost of amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, the story does not mention the cost of the new twofold screening protocol. This is important information for consumers given that insurance may not cover the screening yet."""
Nivolumab immunotherapy helps patients with advanced bladder cancer,1,"The release offers an overview of clinical trial results that were presented June 5 at the annual meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO). The release notes that the drug nivolumab (which is marketed as Opdivo) shrunk the tumors of 24 percent (19 of 78) of patients with metastatic bladder cancer who received the drug. Like a number of other drugs that have been significant advances in cancer treatment, the drug is an antibody that stimulates the immune system to attack cancer cells. It is already approved to treat a number of other cancers (advanced melanoma, lung, kidney, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma). Also of significance: Most of the patients had undergone at least two other courses of treatment. According to the quoted researcher, the 45% survival rate at one year is better than seen with other treatments for this cancer. The release addresses many factors, but does not offer much detail about the study itself and doesn’t address cost — which is likely to be significant — or the fact the lead researcher served on an advisory board to the drug maker. HealthNewsReview.org reviewed a release about a different immunotherapy drug and bladder cancer in May 2016, but some of the points made in that review also apply here. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates 76,960 new cases of bladder cancer and 16,390 deaths from this disease in 2016. This approval of a new drug for treating bladder cancer is part of a wider area of research into immunotherapy, in which drugs target mechanisms of the human immune response. This drug is an example of targeted chemotherapy which is becoming more important as treatments can be fine-tuned to the cancers of individual patients. In patients with intractable cancers, immunotherapy appears to offer some new hope while also bringing sobering questions about affordability and disparity of access by income. These drugs can be extremely expensive — nivolumab was actually called out in an NEJM piece last year because of its cost. And the aggressive marketing of Opdivo directly to consumers also raises questions. Immunotherapy drugs hold promise, but they have limitations — including cost — and it’s important to highlight those limitations for both patients and healthcare providers."

"Bone Proteins Costly In Surgery, Study Says",0,"This story about spinal fusion surgeries that use bone-growth proteins [BMPs] pursues an important cost angle more aggressively than some other stories we saw on this same study. But it missed an important point:   The current study does not have the power to resolve the long-standing question about whether the higher short-term costs of BMPs are offset by lower long-term follow-up care. All it does is confirm that short-term costs are higher. The story mentions the lack of long-term data as a mere caveat. If you strip down the study you see a few interesting observations: About a quarter of spinal fusions now use BMPs. Surgeries on the inside of the spine near the neck cause breathing problems. BMP surgeries appear to be used more often in certain populations, but limitations in the data make any conclusions about disparities premature. That isn’t much to wrap a story around. A reader seeing a story about the cost or complications of BMPs has a broader set of questions:  Does the [initially] more expensive technique produce better outcomes? Which patients are best suited to this surgery? What really is the long-term picture? Is this yet another case of an expensive new technique making a company rich when an established treatment is just as good or better? And what about the angle that most spinal fusion surgeries are deemed unnecessary anyway? This study, a valuable piece of medical research, nonetheless doesn’t address any of those fundamental questions. And neither did the story."

Higher costs for insurers typically mean higher premiums for consumers, but there are many uncertainties.

Walker was reasonably close in relaying the strong upward pressure on costs, but he mischaracterized that as a change in actual premiums, and he ignored the significant subsidies that will cushion the impact of those cost increases for about half of the people who buy insurance on their own.

This Chef Lost 50 Pounds And Reversed Pre-Diabetes With A Digital Program,1,"This NPR story profiled a health app that’s comprehensive — providing both diet and exercise tracking, education about healthy habits, personal coaching, electronic nudging, and peer support. The story featured a patient success story (and one less successful one–which was good to see) and briefly described positive data from a pilot study, leading to a rather upbeat take. However, the article did not provide much context for the technology-based treatment program: How do similar programs compare? What are the costs? What are the long-term outcomes? We think such context, and perhaps a dose of skepticism, is absolutely necessary — especially in the weight loss arena where so many seemingly promising ideas wither over time. Lifestyle factors play a large role in the risk for diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers, and yet people’s personal habits have proven notoriously hard to change.

"Mesothelioma Surgery Improves Quality of Life, Study Finds",0,"This news release describes a small study on surgery for mesothelioma that was presented at a recent American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting. The study involved 114 mesothelioma patients who underwent a procedure called pleurectomy and decortication (PD). Following the surgery, patients generally reported experiencing improved quality of life. Although the news release appropriately explains malignant pleural mesothelioma and PD in an easy-to-understand manner, it omits many important details regarding the study’s design and limitations. It describes the benefits of the surgery but does not mention any of its risks and harms. The release also includes sensational language. We normally caution against covering studies that have not yet been peer-reviewed and published in a journal, since the findings tend to be preliminary. But if presentations are written about in a news release, we would expect a thorough weighing of the evidence, which was not the case here. Malignant mesothelioma is a rare cancer that represents less than 1 percent of all cancers. Prognosis is poor, since the median survival is about one year following diagnosis. Patients should be presented with treatments to improve their quality of life during their possible final year of life. Surgery is certainly an option, but is it really the best for this disease and for all patients? It is also important to present surgical treatments in a balanced, nuanced fashion, so that patients can be informed of the benefits and drawbacks before making such an important decision given the circumstances."

A ‘Polypill’ May Be the Next Big Preventive Fix,0,"This is a story about a physician’s viewpoint on a speculative drug known as a “polypill”  to battle “heart disease, diabetes and other illnesses all at the same time.” This pill would be used in a preventive way among all healthy adults older than 50. While the notion is interesting–can a one-size-fits-all polypill help safely and effectively stave off common diseases of aging–the story didn’t include enough information for readers to understand the issue. Evidence-wise, we don’t get a sense of if there are any clinical trial results examining the benefits of using a polypill among a healthy population of older adults. Important trade-offs like side effects are dismissed, and there’s very little indication of if or when such a pill might be available to a general population. This story contained opinions from the author, but wasn’t labeled as an opinion nor appeared in the opinion section–it ran in the health section. The American population is aging, and the diseases targeted by the polypill are primarily found in older adults. A polypill used in a preventive manner could possibly delay the development of these problems, though it might also carry risks that outweigh these benefits."

Nonprescription diet drug gets OK,2,"""This is a story crafted around the news that the FDA has approved  the sale of a lower dose, over-the-counter (OTC) version of the diet medication orlistat. The story insinuates that the OTC version would have a similar effect on weight loss as does the prescription strength. Although both are likely to be associated with weight loss, the data suggest that the weight loss is dose dependent, so the anticipated weight loss should be about half of that seen with the prescription version. Although the story alluded several times to a 10-20 pound weight loss, it failed to provide a time frame for this weight loss or any indication that weight regain was common after cessation of the drug. Quotes from several clinicians, FDA officials, and the makers of the medication were included in this piece. Some sources expressed appropriate caveats about safety and about efficacy of the new OTC product. Although the story lists some of the gastro-intestinal unpleasantries that occur with the use of this medication, a quote from a paper put out by the FDA  (http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/ANS00951.html ) on the prescription strength form of the drug really says it better:  """"The most common side effects of orlistat are oily spotting, gas with discharge, fecal urgency, fatty/oily stools and frequent bowel movements."""""""
"ANTIDEPRESSANTS DO WORK, AND MANY MORE PEOPLE SHOULD TAKE THEM: MAJOR INTERNATIONAL STUDY",0,"This Newsweek story covers an analysis of the best available trial data to attain a high-level assessment of 21 antidepressant medications. The story gives good context about how prevalent depression is and how many people go without treatment of any kind, and reminds us that psychotherapy is also a viable treatment. And yet the headline goes far beyond the scope of the study by claiming that “many more people” should take antidepressants. That assertion isn’t supported by anything in the story itself, and it’s a major misstep in our view, as treatment decisions should always be fully-informed, shared encounters between people and their physicians. The story didn’t alert readers that most antidepressants were found to offer only a modest benefit, and side effects weren’t considered. The story also missed study limitations and a conflict of interest for one of the people quoted. Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide. It can also be hard to treat — this story mentions the 40% failure rate for antidepressant medications — and many people with depression do not get treatment at all. There has been lingering uncertainty about the effectiveness of some anti-depressants, since manufacturers tend to withhold studies that don’t show positive results and the FDA only approves drugs based on positive studies. A analysis that provides a comprehensive assessment of currently available antidepressant medications is newsworthy, but journalists should be cautious in their interpretations."

Surgery for chronic temporal headaches -- simplified approach shows good results,1,"This news release describes a modified surgical facelift procedure that may help treat a certain type of chronic headache. It’s based on a report written by a surgeon from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, which was published in the Society’s latest journal issue. The study was based on the surgeon’s experience performing the procedure on 19 patients with chronic headaches — commonly referred to as migraine — including a one-year follow-up to assess their migraine symptoms. The news release does a good job quantifying the benefits and describing the procedure but it leaves out some other information that would be helpful to readers such as possible complications from the intervention, limitations of anecdotal evidence, costs and funding sources. The news release uses a tone befitting the nature of the problem and the nature of the evidence. Chronic intractable headaches inflict a huge toll — not only in terms of quality of life but also in time away from work or school and in treatment costs. Drugs commonly prescribed for chronic headaches often go beyond simple painkillers to include triptans (which block serotonin receptors), drugs that prevent migraine onset and tricyclic anti-depressants. Since migraines affect so many, another alternative to pharmacological treatment would be of wide interest. In 2010 the FDA approved botulinum toxin injections for the treatment of migraines after it was observed that the wrinkle treatment eliminated migraines in sufferers who sought the cosmetic treatment for facial wrinkles. In this case, it appears that plastic surgeons observed a reduction in headaches among patients who underwent a cosmetic facelift of the forehead. For those who can’t take — or don’t want — pharmacological treatment, surgery for chronic headaches could prove to be an option. It must be noted that surgery is an invasive procedure compared to other forms of therapy and carries a variety of risks, as well as high costs. Surgery to relieve chronic headaches seems to be a controversial topic, since some researchers doubt its effectiveness."

Stomach pacemaker could help obese lose weight,1,"Strong points:  avoids the cliches and disease-mongering that often accompany weight loss stories; provides cost information, which puts it in a distinct minority of stories we review; and it taps some solid independent experts to put the device into perspective.

Obesity is a major health challenge in the United States and increasingly becoming a challenge around the world. A recent study estimated that 1  in 10 adults worldwide or more than half a billion adults are obese. If clinicians and policymakers are going to alter the course of this epidemic, they need tools that work.

New rapid diagnostic test for Ebola could be game changer in the fight against the disease,2,"This release from the The Lancet plays up a first-of-its-kind rapid diagnostic test for Ebola virus disease (EVD). We’re told the ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test (made by Corgenix) could be a powerful future tool in detecting, monitoring, and controlling outbreaks of EVD. The excitement stems from a recent field study conducted during an Ebola outbreak. After that trial, the release explains, clinicians found the test to be faster than and as reliable as the current standard method for detecting EVD, called real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The release helpfully quantifies both the sensitivity and specificity of the test, giving readers a thorough overview of the test’s performance both in identifying cases of Ebola and ruling it out in people who don’t have it. What’s more, the release tells us, the new rapid-diagnostic test requires just a drop of blood instead a vial of blood, and takes minutes to get a result instead of days. The new test sounds like a potentially critical new tool in rapidly diagnosing EVD, but it has strings attached. The release does disclose these caveats — e.g. the test missed some early cases, it requires refrigeration, and it’s ability to detect EVD early on is limited. Our wish list for this otherwise very complete release includes context about how deadly EVD is and how it’s transmitted; what the symptoms are; what regions its endemic to; etc. We’d also like to know a bit about the regulatory side of things — which of these tests have been approved, and what are the roadblocks to approval/bringing the test to the field? On average, the Ebola virus kills about half of the people it infects. Recent outbreaks in Africa have claimed tens of thousands of lives. Although standard diagnostic tests take hours to process, it might take days for samples to reach a lab from remote places where an outbreak is happening. In addition, there have been reports in Guinea of potentially infected individuals not wanting to travel for testing due to a cultural mistrust of authority figures. So any fast and reliable diagnostic test — especially one requiring only a finger prick — could help workers on the ground detect and control the spread of an outbreak, as well as reduce the risk of infection to themselves (since Ebola virus spreads through bodily fluids)."
“I’ve gotten my life back”: Hopkins reports success with MS treatment,2,"The story describes a new method of administering an existing drug to a subset of patients in the early stages of a debilitating form of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The story discusses why this method of delivery may be an improvement over existing immunosuppressant drug regimens for difficult-to-treat MS cases. And it explains why more information about risk and efficacy of the high-dose treatment is needed before it can be accepted for clinical use. The story adequately describes the small, open-label, pilot-stage study of 9 MS patients. The story appropriately notes inclusion criteria for the study (i.e. patients in the early stages of aggressive MS) and cautions that the preliminary findings may not apply to other people with different subtypes of MS. The suggestion by a study researcher that results of this study could lead to a cure for MS seems premature, especially given the small number of people involved and outcomes at 2 years; however, the story does note the limited information available for HiCy therapy and the need for future randomized controlled trials with a larger group of patients. The story mentions the harms of treatment typically seen in patients taking the pulsed dose of cyclophosphamide, as well as side effects seen in the small group of patients in the HiCy trial. The cost of currently available low-dose, pulsed immune suppressing drugs could have been mentioned. It would be good to know if there would be a potential cost-saving for the patient with HiCy therapy. But the story does note the economics driving drug research and implications for the development of new treatments for people with difficult-to-treat chronic conditions. Overall, though, this was a solid report."

New method could make IVF more effective,0,"This year’s Nobel Prize in Medicine went to Robert Edwards, a UK physiologist who, over 30 years ago, developed the technique for in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Since then, IVF has become an enourmous industry. An individual cycle of IVF can cost $10-15,000 but the average chance of success is roughly 1 in 5 (varying widely according to many factors). Therefore, any improvements in the technique to improve the success rate is welcome news to potential parents. This story reports on a new technique that entails observing the embryo divide and develop to attempt to predict which ones would have the highest chance of success. While this method may be truly an advancement in IVF technology, this story does little to educate readers on its potential importance. It provides inadequate information about the availability, costs and potential harms of IVF. It does not discuss the strength of the evidence to support the new technique nor does it describe the success rates of the procedure compared to existing methods. The story does not quote any independent sources that could have provided some perspective on the importance of the results, which is sorely missing from this story. Most distressing, the story exagerrates the perils of pregnancy by providing such scary statistics as the 50% miscarriage rate. In doing so, it overstates the need for reproductive assistance technologies, including IVF. In the end, this story appears to be little more than a thinly-veiled advertisement for IVF, an industry which is in little need of help. Couples who seek to have children using IVF face high costs and frequent failures. Stories on this topic must tread carefully to not raise unwarranted hopes."

Merck Receives FDA Approval of ZEPATIER™ (elbasvir and grazoprevir) for the Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 1 or 4 Infection in Adults Following Priority Review,2,"Merck’s PR release fills us in on its freshly FDA-approved drug — Zepatier (elbasvir and grazoprevir) — to treat two different forms of hepatitis C and claims to “cure” upwards of 94% of infections based on 12- and 16-week trials. The combination pill is taken once a day throughout treatment. The release seems targeted primarily to healthcare professionals, rather than consumers, so it’s chock-full of jargon and statistics. While the release indicates the risks, benefits and costs, we saw some weaknesses in the presentation of the evidence. For example, the news release did not provide the outcomes for the placebo group, even though the studies compared the drugs with placebo. Nor did it explain that the outcome assessed — sustained virologic response — is a short-term proxy for the longer-term results that patients really care about, such as rates of liver failure and cancer. Speaking of costs, what this release doesn’t cover (although who would expect a for-profit drug company to do so?) is the insane cost of specialty drugs, the rising demand for them, and their increasing burden on the U.S. healthcare system. HealthNewsReview.org contributor Trudy Lieberman expands on this issue in a recent blog post, which happens to focus on another (very expensive) hepatitis C drug. Hepatitis C is caused by a virus that attacks the liver — an organ you can’t live without because it breaks down toxins, fights infections, helps regulate metabolism, and aids digestion. Infections can be passed down in a variety of ways, including from mother to child (during pregnancy), use of unsanitary needles (e.g. drugs or tattoos), or having sex with someone who’s infected. Severe infections can lead to liver transplants, and cure rates with drugs in the past decade were less than 50%. Treatment has evolved rapidly as new drugs hit the market each year. Now drug sponsors are claiming that 80% to more than 90% of chronic infections can be essentially eliminated with drugs, but they do not come cheap. Harvoni, made by Gilead, costs $94,500 per 12-week course of treatment — $1,125 per pill. Gilead’s other hepatitis C drug Sovaldi costs $84,000 per course. And now Zepatier, made by Merck and now FDA-approved, costs $54,600 — what the Financial Times called the latest volley in a hepatitis C drug price war. Unfortunately, the need for such expensive drugs is on the rise, and with it is an increasing burden on the healthcare system. About 3.5 million people in the US live with chronic hepatitis C. And according to the CDC’s latest estimates, the number of new US cases is growing: There were about 16,500 new cases in 2011, 24,700 new cases in 2012, and 29,700 new cases in 2013 — and more than three quarters of these cases lead to a chronic infection. The effect of these drugs on outcomes of reducing effects of Hep C virus on the liver, longevity or cancer rates has never been proven or quantified. Before we can talk about the effect of the price of the drug, we need to quantify the effect (NNTB) of the drug for patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic Hep C."

Type 2 diabetes is not for life,0,"The news release focuses on a Lancet article describing the first-year results of an ongoing two-year study aimed at determining how effective diet-based weight loss can be at achieving remission of type 2 diabetes in adults. The release notes that 45.6 percent of patients who took part in the weight loss program achieved remission of their type 2 diabetes, and that remission was closely correlated with weight loss; the more weight study participants lost, the more likely they were to achieve remission. While the release does a good job of describing the study, it does not mention previous studies related to weight loss and type 2 diabetes. That’s a significant oversight that makes it difficult for readers to place the new findings in context. It’s worth noting that HealthNewsReview.org reviewed a previous release from the same university on earlier findings from the same research group. While the more recent release does a better job of addressing benefits and the quality of the evidence, some problems — such as the failure to address novelty and place the work in context — were not addressed. Further, there is no mention in the release about the conflicts of interest on the part of several authors in their relationships with Counterweight and Cambridge Weight Plans. And like the TIME story on the Newcastle University research, the release doesn’t inform readers about cost and harms of the diet. Type 2 diabetes is a common medical problem. According to the CDC, an estimated 30.3 million Americans have diabetes — and approximately 95 percent of them have type 2 diabetes. And the incidence of type 2 diabetes appears to be on the rise. That means research findings about new treatment options for type 2 diabetes have a large audience. It’s important for related news releases to place these new research findings into context. How do they build on or differ from previous studies? What could that mean for treatment options? These are important considerations for those living with type 2 diabetes, and the release falls short on these points."

But it explained the results of the study in a way that may cause confusion, among other issues. Harnessing bacteria to attack cancer tumors isn’t a new idea, but it’s been gaining interest due to technology that can develop bacterial strains that have fewer side effects and greater therapeutic potential. Yet news stories about early trials like this one should be careful not to provide false hope. In this story, the message that the bacterium “appears to target malignant cells and could provide a new means of fighting cancer” is overly optimistic, given that this is a study that was designed to establish a safe dosage level, not show whether there’s a meaningful clinical benefit."

It presents a clear overview of the method researchers used to detect the protein and includes an independent expert which gives the story balance. The story would have been stronger with a nod to the potential cost and harms of screening tools, and with a more aggressive challenge to the claim that the test has “perfect accuracy.”  We also reviewed stories published by NBCNews.com the Houston Chronicle on this same discovery. By the time it is diagnosed, pancreatic cancer is often too far advanced to respond to treatment. A screening tool that would allow earlier detection and treatment could potentially save lives. There currently is no specific screening test that can reliably detect early-stage pancreatic cancer in people who have no symptoms, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology."
A Touch of Massage Therapy: Reiki Used for Cancer Patients,2,"We give the online version of this column credit for being merely descriptive in its headline: “Reiki used for cancer patients.” Yes.

The story tries to make this point clear, but the point is muddied by some of the more exuberant language in the piece. By referring to it as “a form of healing” and talking about how parts of the body are “treated” by “therapists,” the story legitimizes what is actually an uNPRoven form of massage that at times does not even involve contact between the massage therapist and the patient. Cancer patients often are in extreme pain and can feel deep depression about their condition.

Radiation from CT scans may raise cancer risks,1,"""There is no doubt that advances in imaging technology have revolutionized how we diagnose and treat disease. The past two decades have seen dramatic increases in the utilization of high tech imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). The ever expanding list of indications and uses for these technologies have been a boon for device manufacturers, hospitals and radiologists, however is there a potential for overuse? At what point may the harms of these tests outweigh the benefits? Two new studies published in The Archives of Internal Medicine highlight rather starkly the particular harm of radiation exposure from CT scanning. In one study, the authors predict that between 15,000 and 45,000 future cancers could be caused by ionizing radiation from CT scans. This story clearly describes the harm of radiation exposure from CT scanning. It could have also mentioned that excessive CT scanning can also lead to unecessary follow-up testing and/or procedures for suspicious findings that turn out to be benign. The story could have been improved by elaborating on the strength of the evidence to support the findings of the number of deaths attributable to CT scans. The numbers cited in the story come from a risk model that estimates the expected number of deaths based on the amount of radiation exposure in a particular year. These deaths were not directly observed, but were rather predicted. This approach, while valid, has its own limitations and set of caveats that should be mentioned. It could have also discussed costs of CT scanning, which are substantial and increasing. The story does not quote sources other than the authors of the study. The story should have quoted independent experts who could have provided perspective on the importance of these results. Finally  the story missed some wonderful opportunities to educate consumers on the problem of radiation exposure. The second article in the journal highlights the dramatic differences in radiation exposure in routine clinical CT scans in four academic hospitals. The radiation differences noted were significant with up to a 22 fold difference in exposures seen in the same scans. Radiation exposure from CT scans appears to represent a public health problem, which is particularly important in young and middle aged women. No attempts were made to point out that in many instances other diagnostic methods are available, including MRI, ultrasound and routine xrays that involve less or no radiation. It matters because, as the story explains, """"We’re doing millions of CT scans every year and the numbers are increasing."""""""
"""Expanding the sale of full-strength beer and wine to grocery stores is """"good for everybody.""",1,"""A Your Choice Colorado ad says a ballot measure to expand the sale of full-strength beer and wine to grocery and big box stores will be """"good for everybody."""" The economic impact study funded by large grocery retailers said the proposal would save consumers time and money, create about 200 more grocery stores, add 22,000 new jobs and boost craft beer sales by $125 million. Opponents forecast precisely the opposite effect, saying it would close 700 liquor stores, cause the loss of 10,000 jobs, and hurt craft breweries and wineries. Independent economists say the proposal would increase competition, giving consumers lower prices and convenient one-stop shopping. But they acknowledge that liquor stories will be negatively impacted. The ad makes a fair point about consumer benefits but goes too far in saying the measure works out for all sides."""

Chicken Collagen Tested As Rheumatoid Arthritis Treatment,1,"This is a story reporting on a study comparing oral dosing with chicken collagen (daily) to methotrexate (weekly) for symptom relief for people with rheumatoid arthritis. While doing a good job reporting about the study, the story did not clearly explain the nature (beyond mentioned that they were ‘standard measures’) or extent of the benefits observed. People with arthritis would want to know what was actually measured. Also, the story discussed availability of chicken collagen as a nutritional supplement but didn’t explain if that is similar to the stuff used in the study. This is an important area for research because the standard treatments for rheumatoid arthritis are associated with substantial toxicity, and in the case of methotrexate, are unsafe in pregnancy. That is a particular problem because RA often is diagnosed in younger people and is more common in women."

Beyond wrinkles: Botox is a salve for everything from cerebral palsy to writer’s cramp,1,"This is a thoroughly reported story on a medical therapy that merits skepticism but which has also earned a reasonable amount of scientific respect in recent years. It does a nice job of explaining the myriad uses of Botox in medicine today and issues some needed cautions about potential harms, nonapproved uses, and misuse. The story’s sources are plentiful and appear to be balanced. But is this enough? How good is the evidence to support the various uses of Botox? Are there reasonable alternatives to Botox for some of the conditions it treats? Is it okay to tease a national audience with a headline that shouts one thing, but place deeper in the story the caveats that suggest another? There is extraordinary variability in the quality of the research on Botox from one medical condition to another—missing information important for a national audience that inevitably includes people searching desperately for solutions to intractable problems. For example, our quick literature search turned up more than a score of randomized, controlled trials and systematic reviews on the use of Botox for the involuntary muscle contortions that cause the painful neck disorder known as cervical dystonia–and just one, very small, inadequate trial on Botox treatments for low back pain. The story fails to quantify side effects, most of which seem to be dismissed as transient. And readers might be better served if the story put more meat on the bones of alternative approaches (including no treatment) to some of the conditions Botox treats. Indeed, one could argue that the story’s ultimate effect is that of treatment mongering—simply because it shines so much (mostly flattering) light on Botox. The admonition from one source—“Don’t demand a certain treatment just because you saw a headline”—can’t compete with the magazine cover’s actual headline: “The Botox Boom” followed inside by, “You thought Botox was all about looks? It's also a salve for everything from cerebral palsy to writer's cramp”. In spite of the story’s multiple caveats about Botox, the headline hypes a therapy that may be a boon for some, but a bust for others."
New Pill Found to Cut Weight With Few Side Effects: Study,2,"The story does a good job placing this drug into the context of the current competition to bring a new blockbuster weight-loss pill to market, and it brings in a critical, independent voice, albeit late in the story. But it doesn’t provide enough details to allow readers to make their own judgments about the quality of the evidence. The story focuses too much on the drugs and not enough on whether this drug (or any drug) is a viable remedy for obesity. The story – and the issue – is a big deal because obesity is such a big deal in the US, with major impacts on morbidity, mortality, quality of life, and costs. People, doctors, health plans, and drug companies all want treatment options that help people lose weight and keep it off safely. This story reports on several new drugs that are likely to gain market approval by the FDA, which would effectively double the number of drug treatment options currentlly available to patients and providers. The biggest problem with weight loss drugs in the past has been that the side effects seemed to greatly overshadow their impact on body weight, and all weight loss drugs deserve close scrutiny on their side effect profile. Given the high prevalence of obesity in our country (1/3 of all adults), close attention should be paid to the cost of any new interventions, which if applied broadly could dramatically impact national health care expenditures."
"“In a matter of days, and in some cases the moment may even have passed, that we’ve reached the peak of the rate of infections.”",1,"U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey wants the president to reopen the economy, and in an interview with Politico, he said he sees clear signs that the country is ready – even as top public health officials studying the coronavirus warn against moving too quickly. On Monday, states reported at least 1,500 new fatalities, a figure below last week’s running tally of roughly 2,000 deaths every 24 hours. And the number of new cases reported Monday – about 23,000 – was also well below last week’s trend of 30,000 to 50,000 new cases each day. Models created by a University of Washington global health research center indicate it’s been five days since the use of hospital resources peaked nationwide. But these models don’t account for the sort of relaxation of social distancing rules that Toomey is pushing for."

Study: Lots of red meat increases mortality risk,2,"This story covers a big study that reports a statistical association between a diet high in red meat and a higher death rate. The report does a number of things well:  It indicates early on that the results support previous findings and current recommendation about red meat, while adding new data. It quotes a variety of sources, including two self-interested representives of the meat industry who question the findings. This attention to the opposition enhances rather than undercuts the report’s credibility. It translates the findings into dinner-table terms: high consumption in this study is defined as about a quarter pound hamburger per day, low is 5 ounces per week. That’s really useful to readers. The report has two significant shortcomings. The language of the story – e.g., “lots of red meat increases mortality risk” – suggests that cause-and-effect has been established when this kind of observational study simply CAN NOT establish causation. It can only point to statistical association. The story never made that clear. So even discussing “risk” is an overstatement. Then, when choosing to discuss “risk,” it used only relative data [“a 22 percent lower risk of death” by cancer for low-red eaters, for example], not the absolute data [1.3 percent compared to .06 percent]. But once the story started using “risk” terminology without explaining that cause-and-effect and risk cannot be firmly established by such a study, it had already missed the mark. We know we hold the bar high with this expectation that stories explain the quality of the evidence. But it is not simply splitting hairs; it is inaccurate to use language that does not fit the evidence. Journalists and should consumers should review the excellent guest column by Mark Zweig and Emily DeVoto, entitled “Does The Language Fit the Evidence? – Association Versus Causation.” One of our medical editors wrote to me about this topic: “I can tell you, the average practicing physician (one of the presumed target audiences for the medical literature) has a less than firm grasp of this difference! I have been teaching evidence-based medicine for years, and it seems that our residents finally get this by the end, but I don’t think it’s a skill that was routinely taught in medical training before the past decade or two, nor one that sticks with most docs.” None of this denigrates the importance of the study or the quality of the work. But all studies have limitations and news about research should explain those limitations."

Resveratrol impacts Alzheimer's disease biomarker,2,"Resveratrol is an antioxidant compound found in grapes and red wine.This news release from Georgetown University Medical Center does a thorough job laying out the main points of a resveratrol phase II clinical trial. It reasonably talks about the study’s findings and design, while cautioning readers on how researchers must pursue further studies before recommending the drug. Given this cautious overall framing, we view the release’s omissions as relatively minor. One concern is that the release could have put the potential benefits and the harms into better perspective. For example, readers aren’t told how much levels of the biomarker (Abeta40) would normally decrease in Alzheimer’s patients and how this compares to what was found in the study. Readers also don’t know how many patients suffered from side effects from the concentrated supplement. It would also be interesting to know what existing Alzheimer’s drugs already on the market can do and how resveratrol might compare. But for the most part, this news release – including its use of language – was appropriately tempered and very informative, hitting home the message that these research findings are preliminary. Note: We also looked at how this study was covered by Time magazine and CNN, and compared the framing of the results in this news release vs. the subsequent stories. Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills. It is a condition associated with aging, since most symptoms appear when people hit their mid-60s. Estimates vary, but experts suggest that more than 5 million Americans may have Alzheimer’s, according to the National Institute on Aging. Many of these treatments concentrate not on reversing the disease, but on helping people maintain mental function, manage behavioral symptoms, and slow or delay disease progression. In addition, drugs on the market help only some patients and may be effective for only a limited amount of time. Consequently, any research highlighting a new drug candidate that prevents Alzheimer’s or delays its onset would be newsworthy for both patients and clinicians. Since Alzheimer’s is also a complex disease, having a variety of treatment options would also prove to be beneficial."

Implant procedure helps patients with sacroiliac joint pain,1,"This news release summarizes a recently published paper on a randomized trial of sacroiliac joint fusion (SJF) using titanium implants versus non-surgical therapy for treating sacroiliac joint dysfunction (SJD), an inflammation of the joints connecting the lower spine and pelvis. The study included 148 patients with chronic low back pain caused by SJD who were treated at 19 U.S. spine surgery clinics. While the study was funded and staffed by the manufacturers of the implant, the release doesn’t overtly hype the surgical procedure or promote the manufacturer. However, failure to point out the trial design’s potential bias and the inadequate discussion of harms were weaknesses, according to our reviewers. Chronic low back pain is a common cause of disability in the United States and available treatments have not been associated with a cure or even major long-term relief for most individuals. Attempts to identify specific causes of the pain have also met with limited success. One potential pain generator is the sacroiliac joint (SIJ). In recent years, considerable research has helped identify those patients with chronic low back pain due to the SIJ and then to offer treatments. Few high quality studies have compared treatments for patients thought to have pain due to the SIJ. SJF is becoming a widely used treatment for a condition that poses chronic pain and disability in its sufferers. A minimally invasive treatment for SJD that has a reasonable success rate and is safe is desirable as a treatment option."

Artificial retina gives woman limited vision after decades of darkness,0,"The journalistic challenge with a story like this is to balance hype and hope. This review takes in both the broadcast segment that appeared on CNN and the similar but longer print version that appears on the CNN web site. First, by choosing a study subject who has had promising but unspectacular results, the story provides a more realistic view of outcomes than would a piece wrapped around a subject, like one referred to in the story, who is said to be able to shoot baskets. Second, the story supplements positive comments with those tempered by realism. Eight paragraphs are devoted to purely positive comments. Four tamp down expectations with more realistic statements about the limits of current outcomes and future benefits. Five paragraphs are internally balanced with positive and tempered views. The tempered comments come lower in the story, however, and follow an opening anecdote brimming with emotion and hope. The story ends in a similar fashion. Taking all things into account, the story tilts too positive. What could have balanced the scales? A quote from a truly disinterested source. All three sources in the story are involved with the research: a physician treating the patient, a source from an advocacy group involved with the research, and a spokeman for Second Sight Inc., the company that makes the device. The perspective of an ophthalmologist who treats patients with retinitis pigmentosa, yet has no involvement with development of an artificial retina, could have added balance. And finally, the story fails to put this device in context of other artificial retina development efforts and other technologies intended to improve or restore sight. The result is a false sense that we are learning of a dramatic breakthrough of one device. Not true. Many other devices and treatments are in development, enough so that a government agency is supporting them all. The viewers should have been told that. For a long time researchers have worked to develop devices to restore vision to the blind. This CNN segment on early testing of one company’s second-generation artificial retina provides a useful snapshot of one product as it’s being used on one patient."

China: Tests Find Bird Flu Vaccine Safe,0,"While this article did contain a cautionary note that the vaccine reported upon would ‘face more tests before it could be approved for human use’ the focus of the article is that the Chinese have developed a vaccine to protect individuals at high risk of contracting H5N1. It is not clear why the Chinese announcement has generated such enthusiasm. A trial of a H5N1 vaccine was completed in the US (45 subjects) demonstrating the safety of the product. The optimal dose for peak immune response was also preliminarily identified. Recruitment is ongoing for a Phase 3 trial of the product. This information is readily available at http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/2005/H5N1QandA.htm. Although it is possible that additional testing will find that the vaccine reported might be both safe and effective protection against H5N1 infection, without the data indicating both of these to be true, the entire article is mere speculation. It does not provide any information about this flu strain or vaccine development that is helpful to the reader and only serves to fuel the fire of concern about the possibility of global pandemic without providing any context for evaluating the potential of occurence. Bird flu needs to be put into context . There have been about 200 people known to be infected and about 100 deaths worldwide. Although this 50% mortality rate has been quoted, it is unclear if this is the case. It is very likely that a small minority of cases of bird flu have actually been identiifed. It is very likely that hundreds if not thousands of people have been infected, become ill and recovered. Bird flu has the potential for mutating just like any other influenza virus. If it does and can be spread from human to human we will have a problem. So it is something for health authorities to be concerned about and a vaccine is important. But,for perspective, last year standard influenza hospitalized about 200,000 people and killed over 36,000 people in the US according to the CDC. This article does not provide information that serves the reader well."
Medimetriks announces the results of a successful Phase 2 trial of MM36 in Atopic Dermatitis; Study results and design published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (JAAD),1,"This news release describes the results of a somewhat small (121 patients) phase 2 safety and efficacy trial of a topical non-steroidal treatment for mild-to-moderate symptoms of eczema (atopic dermatitis). The release is based on a study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, and offers substantial detail about the company (Medimetriks) which owns the U.S. rights to the experimental treatment, dubbed MM36. The MM36 compound is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ointment believed to stop itching and redness by blocking chemicals released by an enzyme known as PDE4 subtype B and active in causing inflammation. The release describes the percentage of improvement in symptoms over a period of eight weeks, but doesn’t describe or quantify what improvement means. And it highlights several alternative treatments, but offers no data on how MM36 compares with these existing therapies. Readers will learn little to nothing about the makeup of the test group, side effects, or costs. A WSJ story on this eczema study, which was also reviewed by HealthNewsReview.org, shared an excessive optimism with respect to approval and availability of this treatment still in development. As the release notes with admirable detail, atopic dermatitis — and the “red, swollen and cracked skin” that accompanies the “intense” itching associated with it — is estimated to strike 18 million people in the U.S. alone. Moreover, current therapies, such as corticosteroids, cause unwanted side effects when used over long periods of time, and some burning and stinging. Most people who have experienced eczema would agree that while not life-threatening, the symptoms are sometimes disfiguring and can be extremely unpleasant. A treatment that targets a particular enzymatic pathway without the potential downsides of current therapies would thus be welcome. And because these conditions are often chronic, the markets for such products can be highly profitable."

But did he partially change his position or make inconsistent statements, which would earn him a Half Flip? A plain reading of the Wisconsin Eye interview is that Fallone didn’t express a problem at all with the Supreme Court’s take on recusals. In response to a pretty general, and pretty clear, question, he offered a sweeping endorsement of the status quo, which includes the rule backed by Roggensack. So the answer is strikingly inconsistent with his rhetoric only a few weeks later. For that, we think this merits a Half Flip."""

New drug shows promise in fighting breast cancer,0,This was a Phase 1 study – not even designed to prove efficacy. Yet the headline talks about “promise” and the body text describes results in two out of 97 patients – only with breast cancer. It feels like a local story promoting local research without appropriate context. Would the newspaper have reported this if it occurred in another city in another state? No chance. So why does local research get promoted when it’s such an early stage that it would never be publicized if it came from anywhere else? One important part of the story was actually the interview with a breast cancer survivor who said “A lot of these things will shrink a tumor. But what we look at as advocates is overall survival.”  And this research is a long way off from being able to show that.

The research joins a growing number of studies of the effects of testosterone therapy that, together, constitute a mixed landscape of results. It’s unclear if this release will help readers navigate that landscape with more confidence. There’s nothing sensational or overblown about the description of the study or its findings, and there is substantial detail on the methodology and at least a hint toward limitations. There is some solid, commendable writing here. What we were looking for was a more clear-cut statement regarding what this study can and cannot tell us — specifically that it’s unclear if testosterone treatment or some other factor is responsible for the cardiovascular benefits that were observed by the researchers. We thought that would help clear up what can be a confusing topic for consumers. “Low-T” has been raised to the level of a health problem in American society, making it important to figure out if the merits of testosterone therapy actually do trump the debits. This large observational study may serve as one important cog in that evaluative process, but patterns that would lead to treatment recommendations remain elusive."

"Study: Vaccine for Breast, Ovarian Cancer Has Potential",2,"While the story does many things well, the overall framing of the story is that the vaccine “shows promise,” when the evidence actually points in the other direction.

Right now, there more than 10,000 cancer-related clinical trials recruiting patients. Cancer has foiled scientists repeatedly with treatments that initially seemed promising in the laboratory or in a very small group of people and later proved unworkable on a larger scale. It’s a difficult task — but a crucial one — for reporters to ask tough questions of the evidence and a wide range of sources before deciding whether one of these thousands of experimental treatment options merits coverage."
Older Patients Can Benefit From Lung Cancer Surgery,0,"According to this story from NPR, new study findings apparently challenge the conventional wisdom that surgery to remove lung cancer is too hard to bear for older adults. The story overstates the findings, however, by saying patients “can benefit.” The study was observational only; it was a “competing risks analysis” to gather and assess data about the outcomes of surgery for early lung cancer. The researchers’ chief conclusion was “In patients who undergo curative-intent resection of stage I NSCLC [non-small cell lung cancer], noncancer-specific mortality is a significant competing event, with an increasing impact as patient age increases.” In plain language, many older lung cancer patients die of non-cancer problems. Somehow NPR translated that to “Older Patients Can Benefit From Lung Cancer Surgery.” An optimistic and potentially true statement, but certainly not in line with the researchers’ more conservative conclusion as written in the journal where the findings were published. Unfortunately the NPR story relies more on anecdote rather than evidence, and didn’t push back enough on what this study can and can’t tell us. The story may leave readers with the impression that this is solid evidence that surgery is a good option for older adults. The study gave researchers some insights into what happens to older adults after surgery, but it was not a randomized controlled trial that could show which interventions benefit patients most."

Exact Sciences and Mayo Clinic study shows promise of new blood-based lung cancer test,1,"This release describes very preliminary work on a lung cancer screening test that examines blood plasma from lung cancer patients and healthy controls. The work focused on isolating specific methylated DNA  (cells that influence gene expression) markers in the blood that existed in cancer patients but which were absent in controls. The research will be presented in a poster session at an upcoming meeting of the American Association of Cancer Research (ACCR). The release gets credit for employing mostly cautious language when describing results but it comes up short in other areas; namely it omits costs, and pertinent descriptions of benefits, availability and quality of evidence. In addition, the release doesn’t mention that the study involved smokers — one has to go to the abstract to find that information — and that may lead some readers to think the screening test could be appropriate for anyone, including healthy non-smokers. In addition, red flags go up whenever we see the words “simple blood test” in a news release or story. There is no such thing, as we’ve addressed numerous times. The release points out that, “Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality, resulting in 1.7 million deaths globally and more than 150,000 deaths in the United States every year.”  (The American Cancer Society cites about 156,000 lung cancer deaths annually.) And since a lung cancer diagnosis can often come as the disease has progressed considerably, the dream of an earlier warning is enticing. There is a use for a “simple blood test” to guide further diagnostic testing in lung cancer, such as being able to differentiate benign lung nodules picked up incidentally during a chest scan from cancer. Such a test could theoretically reduce unnecessary repeat CT scans. However, readers should bring a healthy amount of skepticism to early reports about such tests and reserve confidence until substantive studies show strong, comprehensive, positive results. Otherwise, readers will suffer disappointment at believing in advances that fail to actually hold up to the hype."

Eye Tracking Has High Sensitivity as a Biomarker for Concussion; Eye Tracking Detects Concussion with Sensitivity Comparable to that of Blood Tests for Heart Attack,2,"This news release is a wonderfully detailed summary of a study of a novel eye-tracking measure of brain injury, one with the potential to significantly advance the accuracy of tests to detect the severity of traumatic brain injuries, whose consequences can range from a temporary and mild concussion to permanent damage and death. The release ranks as a very good piece of explanatory journalism, going beyond the results of a single study to inform readers about the complexity of brain injury and the challenges inherent in attempts to identify precise and consistent biomarkers for concussion. Because the release makes ample use of good quotes, metaphors, and attention to numbers, journalists and other readers of this news release will come away with a good understanding of a significant clinical problem (over- and under- diagnosis of “mild” traumatic brain injury) in young people; and ample context for evaluating the significance of the eye-tracking test. The description of the eye-tracking test itself — which requires patients to watch a music or other video on a TV screen — is deft. Physicians and other medical personnel in emergency rooms, on playing fields, and in offices struggle with diagnosing concussions and determining the severity of the underlying brain injury. While brain imaging can identify patients with fractures, bleeds, and strokes, the ability to categorize the severity of patients with head injuries without anatomic abnormalities is limited. The authors report on a new test that can potentially categorize patients with head injuries as having a concussion or not, as well as potentially to assess the severity. Though the results presented are encouraging, the value of the test remains to be determined. Only by applying this prospectively to patients presenting to clinicians with head injuries and then following outcomes over time, can we be certain whether the test will improve our prediction over usual care. Where it may be most helpful would be in patients with normal findings on the test – they can be reassured. But this has not yet been proven. Similarly, it remains to be seen whether an abnormal test result can be effectively used to improve care. A challenge the authors identify is the lack of a gold-standard definition of concussion. Because of that uncertainty, only studies that examine outcomes over time will help determine whether this test improves patient care or not."

Vaccine offers new hope for removing precancerous cervical lesions,0,"Correction: Since posting this review, we’ve learned that this story wasn’t an original piece of journalism but rather a verbatim reprint of a news release from the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. There was no warning or disclaimer as to the origin of the text. Accordingly, we’ve downgraded the score from 4 stars to 0, to reflect the fact that this wasn’t a piece of original journalism. Read this related blog post for further explanation. This very thorough analysis of a newly published study of an experimental vaccine had much to admire, including clear quantification of benefits and an acknowledgment of study dropouts and potential harms. It could have been improved by two things: an independent source or two providing their take on the publication and some information about what the vaccine might ultimately cost patients and insurers. The development of a vaccine to prevent human papilloma virus (HPV) infection was a big advance in efforts to prevent cervical cancer. This study shows that a similar experimental vaccine can be of benefit to women who’ve already been infected with HPV and whose cervixes show evidence of precancerous changes. According to the study, the new vaccine can boost the body’s natural immune response and cause high-grade precancerous changes in the cervix to regress. It can also help clear the virus from the cervix, reducing the risk of future cancers. The current treatments for precancerous changes all involve some form of invasive procedure with tissue destruction in the cervix, which can compromise future childbearing ability. Thus the vaccine may offer a significant advantage over currently available treatments."

For instance, we’re not told that: * Research presented at a conference has not been peer-reviewed and is considered preliminary;* 12 people in a study is tiny;* There are limitations with what you can say given the extreme short-term length of the study (2 nights);* Overall, the technology has only been tested at night and not in a home-based, real-world scenario; see the MedPageToday coverage for such caveats;* This evidence isn’t of such overwhelming quality that no further research is necessary to prove it works: the investigators are planning future studies in the home setting;* Challenges remain, as pointed out in a recent Lancet editorial, in getting the approach and algorithms to work during the daytime, when there will be varying meals and periods of physical activity. The results of 12 people using a new technology for 1 night presented without peer review — the extremely early phase of this research simply isn’t conveyed to readers."
How well do flu shots work? Here’s what the science says.,2,"This story asks a simple, straightforward question that annually affects much of the population — do flu vaccines work, and how well? The story looks at the evidence offered from a host of studies, giving a fair appraisal of what the data does and does not tell us.

And like the autumn colors, the effectiveness of the flu vaccine can change year to year. This story both explains why there is such variability and answers the questions that most people would, or should, have about getting an annual flu shot."

The date of Earth Day was chosen as April 22 by the Unicorn Killer to coincide with Vladimir Lenin's birthday.,0,"A good many historical events and birthdays (including those of Isabella I, Emmanuel Kant, and J. Robert Oppenheimer) have taken place on April 22, but neither any of them nor Ira Einhorn has anything to do with the choice of that day for Earth Day. The true (and more mundane) explanation is that when founder Gaylord Nelson was pondering when his first “National Teach-In on the Crisis of the Environment” should take place, he wanted a date that fell during the Spring but would be far enough into the season that the weather would likely be temperate enough for outdoor celebrations. He also wanted a date late enough in the calendar to avoid any potential conflicts with school exams, spring breaks, or Easter/Passover celebrations that might find students too busy or too far away from school to attend the teach-in. Having determined that the week of April 19–25 was optimal for his purposes, Nelson selected the mid-point of that week (Wednesday, April 22) for what would later become celebrated as the first “Earth Day.”"

New Antibiotic Packs a Punch Against Bacterial Resistance,0,"The news release reports on the development of a new “mechanism of action” in the antibiotic vancomycin. However, while the release tells readers that vancomycin now has “new superpowers,” which “could eliminate the threat of antibiotic-resistant infections for years to come,” the new form of vancomycin has yet to be tested in an animal model — much less gone through the clinical trials in humans that would be necessary to determine how viable the new form may be in treating patients on any kind of widespread basis. The release also says that “bacteria are only now developing resistance” to vancomycin — which is misleading. Vancomycin-resistant bacteria were first reported in 1987, 30 years ago — and papers (like this one) on how to limit the spread of vancomycin resistance date back more than 20 years. Is the new work interesting? Absolutely. But it is much too early to bandy about the kind of language used here. The rise of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens is a huge problem. As the 2015 paper, “The Antibiotic Resistance Crisis,” states: “The rapid emergence of resistant bacteria is occurring worldwide, endangering the efficacy of antibiotics, which have transformed medicine and saved millions of lives. Many decades after the first patients were treated with antibiotics, bacterial infections have again become a threat.” And that’s not an overstatement. The paper goes on to note that antibiotic-resistant strains of MRSA bacteria alone “kill more Americans each year than HIV/AIDS, Parkinson’s disease, emphysema, and homicide combined.” In other words, developments regarding new antibiotics that work against bacterial infections are certainly newsworthy. They do not, however, benefit from being over-hyped. The advance discussed in this news release is interesting and newsworthy, but it is several steps removed from clinical relevance — and that is far from clear in the news release."

Kerastem Reports Successful US Phase II Hair Growth Clinical Trial Results,0,"This release reports on a small phase 2 clinical trial that tested a new surgical approach to treating hair loss. It involves liposuction to remove specific fat cells, treating them and then re-injecting them into the scalp to foster hair growth. The trial itself is early, and small, with each experimental arm using less than two dozen participants. The information it offers for positive results is insufficient for readers to really assess the change the treatment provides. It fails to mention anything about costs or discuss any risks of this treatment, nor does it mention anything other than one alternative, and it does that in passing. The release appears to focus more on laying the groundwork for marketing this new treatment than it does providing information helpful for human health. It also medicalizes a condition that might not be that serious to many who have it. To our knowledge the study results have not been published. There is a summary of the trial on ClinicalTrials.gov. Hair loss is a common result that comes with aging for a certain part of the population, both men and women. It’s a psychological issue for some; it causes no known medical problems. The National Institutes of Health suggests that it “affects an estimated 50 million men and 30 million women in the United States,” which represents a huge market for clinics working to remedy that. In fact, the release itself mentions that the “global hair loss treatment market generates more than $7 Billion annually.” Readers deserve much more useful information."

16:8 FASTING DIET LINKED TO WEIGHT LOSS AND HEALTH BENEFITS IN STUDY,1,"This story described a small study of whether a regime that restricts eating to an eight-hour daily window help people reduce their risk factors for developing metabolic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. The story’s main strength is that it provided caveats early and often about the small size and short duration of the study and the need for more rigorous trials. However, it didn’t give enough information to help readers understand whether weight loss and blood pressure improvements were sufficient to reduce disease risk. The headline also oversells the findings by stating that the fasting plan is “linked to weight loss and health benefits.” In fact, the study found most metabolic risk factors unchanged. The story also would have been stronger had it used people-first language to help reduce stigma around obesity. There’s a lot of excitement around Intermittent fasting as a strategy to lose weight and reduce risk factors for metabolic diseases like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The so-called 16:8 fasting diet is just the latest flavor. Early-phase studies like this one provide just a clue of how well they work. News reporting needs to refrain from hyperbole and focus on the many caveats around these trials. This one did a little bit, but not enough."

Gene therapy makes a big advance treating hemophilia B blood disorder,2,"iStock / Getty Images Plus A small, early-stage study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that a single intravenous infusion of a novel bioengineered gene therapy treatment helped spare nine of 10 hemophilia B sufferers from repeated injections of blood-clotting factor to prevent debilitating bleeding episodes. This well-written story shares that information carefully and clearly. However, more details about the years-long road ahead for this treatment’s development and about possible ties between the researchers and the funders would have made the piece stronger. Complicating the care taken by the reporter, however, is a glaring headline that promises much more than this small study can deliver (“Gene therapy makes a big advance treating hemophilia B blood disorder”). Whether this particular treatment revolutionizes the landscape for hemophilia B sufferers will remain an open question for some years. People who have inherited the hemophilia B bleeding disorder face a lifetime of replacement therapy: injecting clotting factor when life deals them a stumble or a scrape. Gene therapy research appears to be on the cusp of offering an alternate treatment that would allow these individuals to lead normal lives. While it is important for journalists to track progress toward such an important goal, it is also critical that stories tread cautiously to avoid giving false hope at early stages."
A 31-year-old British woman died of ‘cannabis poisoning’ in October 2013.,3,"The fact of the matter is that unexplained, sudden deaths occasionally strike down healthy individuals. The absence of a clear explanation for a death should not compel acceptance of a scientifically implausible one, however. In our view, death from direct cannabis toxicity is unlikely, as this event is generally viewed to be medically impossible. The incidence of a heart attack as a contributing factor in the case of death that is not otherwise fully explainable is certainly a possibility, but the notion that smoking half a joint would trigger a fatal heart attack in a person who did not exhibit any existing cardiovascular disease strains credulity. Accordingly, we rank this claim as unproven."

Further, wireless technology is so common in 2020 as to be ubiquitous, making the need for “a wire” completely obsolete; we consider the “IV” claim to be so ridiculous (as there are many far less obvious places to hide an IV than out in plain view on one’s wrist during a debate on a stage from behind a podium) as to not even be worth fact-checking."

Good news for people who love spicy food,1,"The story opens with a click-bait headline, a brief description of the main study finding, and then pulls its own punch by detailing the limitations of the observational study. We’re pleased to see the caveats high up before any readers head to the grocery to buy some red hot chili peppers. But we’d be happier to see such a story be put into more context, with some discussion of other dietary factors that affect death rates and some outside experts to comment on what this study really means for the American eaters of any kind of peppers. How dietary factors may influence life — how long and vigorously one lives — is of great interest to readers of health news. And yet dietary research that focuses on singular ingredients (or individual nutrients) inevitably ends up being click-baity. Regardless of how well a study is reported, these stories contribute to the deification/demonization of specific foods. In turn, it fuels the idea of superfoods and fad diets while simultaneously distracting from bigger picture issues around healthy living."
Tell-Tale Biomarker Detects Early Breast Cancer in NIH-Funded Study,0,"This news release sets out to describe a novel technical enhancement to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology using a fibronectin-targeting contrast agent that has the potential to detect micrometastases (breakaway tumor cells that can spread) and to help predict how aggressive the spreading cancer is likely to be. The release deserves good marks for packing in a great deal of information about how cancer spreads and how this technology might potentially play a role in facilitating earlier detection. Nevertheless, we had some significant concerns with how the findings are presented to readers. Most troubling is that the release fails to note that the work was done in mice until about two-thirds of the way through. It’s simply misleading not to acknowledge that the research involved mice somewhere high up in the release rather than burying it far down in the document. Another nugget missing from the early paragraphs is that it’s the “enhancement” (i.e. a new contrasting agent) rather than “MRI” itself that is of interest and novelty here. That could confuse readers who at first glance may be led to believe that standard MRI can now help physicians find these early new seeds of cancer, as well as predict their level of severity and presage their conquest. Surprisingly, there is also no mention of the scientists’ claims that the work was the first demonstration of the effectiveness of this form of molecular MRI/contrast agent technology in the detection of breast cancer micrometastases. And there is little or no real quantification related to the sensitivity and specificity of the detection method, particularly as compared to current gold standard imaging or use of other biomarkers to detect breast cancer spread. So despite some notable strengths, this release’s omissions and lack of attention to the most important findings and details make it overall a confusing and potentially misleading account of the research. Metastases have been recognized as the major cause of death in breast cancer patients for at least half a century, and scientists have expended vast resources in an effort to: a) detect them early enough to begin new or systemic treatments; and b) figure out which tumor types are most likely to spread; and c) find and exploit biomarkers likely to give the earliest possible clue to spread. Thus, the results of new research such as the work from the National Institutes of Health and Case Western Reserve described in this release have the potential to alter the landscape of breast cancer diagnosis and therapy, and eventually improve outcomes for breast cancer patients. The biology of metastases is complex, however, and readers need information that is carefully put in context and in a realistic time frame with respect to clinical application."

Experimental flu treatment may help related virus,1,"The study under consideration is a very early one in the potential life of a new drug and the results, while impressive to those in the field, do not warrant the enthusiasm of the story. The story fails to note that parainfluenza virus infections do not cause serious disease in the majority of people. The story does not provide any specifics of the study design or explicit information about the results. Only those involved in the study were quoted and while there were several attempts to tone down the enthusiasm, the overall tone of the story is strikingly positive for an early preclinical study. The majority of the authors of the study are employees of the company making the drug and one of the authors is listed as the inventor of the drug for use in this setting. This should have been clearly noted in the story. Parainfluenza viruses can  cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infections especially in  children. By the age of 5 years, almost all children will have been  exposed to the virus. Symptoms range from mild cold-like syndromes to  life-threatening pneumonias. The infections can be serious in very  young children, the elderly, and in people with immune system  deficiencies. There are no specific treatments available for  parainfluenza infections. Identification of an antiviral drug that can  reduce the viral load and presumably prevent symptoms from escalating  would indeed be welcomed. But a story on a study in rats can tell you only so much about the drug in question."
Less-invasive heart valve replacement tied to better quality of life,0,"This story reports a meta-analysis of 20 studies that measured functional and quality-of-life outcomes for patients who underwent a minimally-invasive procedure called transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR, to fix a narrowing of the aortic valve. The story spells out several study limitations and included multiple expert perspectives. But, it may have confused readers because in several places it used medical terminology that relates to blood vessel surgery, not heart valve surgery. And, by not discussing risks or costs of the surgery, the story could leave readers with the impression that the surgery is low-risk and cheaper than alternatives. Aortic stenosis, a condition that decreases blood flow from the heart, occurs in about 2% of people over 65 years, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. In the last decade the introduction of minimally invasive TAVR procedures — which involve inserting a replacement valve in place of the damaged one via a catheter — have provided a treatment option for patients at high risk for open-heart surgery due to advanced age or other medical conditions. Selection criteria for the procedure is expected to broaden to treat lower risk groups, according to the authors of this analysis, who say their review “provides evidence that benefits for functional capacity and (health-related quality of life) have been maintained.”"

However, this piece tends to downplay the likelihood of an unsuccessful outcome, especially for severe cases.

It should have mentioned that treatment for Twin-to-Twin syndrome is an area of evolving research and there is uncertainty over which cases will benefit and to what degree from available treatment options. Further, while seemingly healthy babies may be born, there is less research about their long-term prognosis and potential for serious developmental and health problems."

New breast cancer drug may be effective against other types of cancer,0,"This detailed news release from the University of Pennsylvania describes results of a literature review of small clinical trials that suggest far broader treatment possibilities for a type of cell-cycle or checkpoint inhibitor drug already approved by the FDA for its effectiveness against a form of hormone-dependent breast cancer. The drug, palbociclib, interferes with the hallmark rapid division of cancer cells by inhibiting two so-called cyclin-dependent kinases (or CDKs), the enzymes CDK4 and CDK6, which ramp up cell proliferation and are widely present in a variety of malignant tumors. These cell cycle saboteurs are the hot new focus of individualized cancer treatments because of their relatively non-toxic side effects and — alone and in combination with other drugs — their ability to extend progression-free survival. The release does a good job of noting the rapid emergence and track record of palbociclib, which is taken usually once a day by mouth, and its potential use in lymphoma, other forms of breast cancer, sarcomas and teratomas. The release would have been made stronger if it had included more information about the type of breast cancer palbociclib was approved for by the FDA (hormone receptor positive tumors), and about costs, along with more data about prevalence of the cancers it already treats and may have the potential to treat. We also think the release gets ahead of itself when talking in unqualified terms about the drug’s “potentially broad applicability” and “real promise for addressing a variety of cancers.” Those applications may pan out and then again they may not; the release only seems to consider the first possibility. To say that CDK and other checkpoint inhibitors are exciting oncologists and their patients alike is an understatement. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is fast-tracking new ones and existing ones for additional uses, and drug makers already are pouring extraordinary resources into marketing them. To be sure, these drugs — as the Penn release points out — are not cure-alls, do carry side effects, and still seem in many cases to work best only when combined with radiation and other drug therapies. And — as the release fails to point out — they are mega-expensive. Cancer patients and their families are right to be hopeful about the value of palbociclib and other cell cycle therapies. But the hope is that news releases and news stories will also underscore the clinical limitations and accessibility issues that accompany these new treatments."

Common cold duration is shortened similarly by zinc acetate and zinc gluconate lozenges,1,"This news release describes results of a meta-analysis of seven studies on the use of zinc lozenges for shortening the duration of common colds. The study compared the effectiveness of two kinds of zinc salt in lozenges: zinc acetate and zinc gluconate. Although the studies with zinc acetate lozenges shortened colds more than those with zinc gluconate lozenges, the difference wasn’t large enough to be statistically significant. Researchers also compared the effectiveness of various doses of zinc in the lozenges and found that five trials that used low doses of 85 to 92 mg per day were just as effective as trials that used 192 to 207 mg per day. The conclusion of the study was that zinc lozenges do shorten the length of the common cold, but more studies are needed to confirm optimal ingredients of lozenges and the ideal dosage. The news release is meticulous about accuracy in reporting the study findings, but doesn’t provide any information about when zinc should be taken, the actual benefit in terms of days shaved off from suffering cold symptoms, and alternatives and disadvantages of using zinc to treat the common cold. Zinc lozenges as a means of treatment for the common cold have begun to get widespread public attention in the past three to five years. With colds being an issue that touches many people at least once a year, it is useful for the general public to have information about what type of zinc lozenge could be most effective."

Got Low Back Pain? Massage Therapy May Rub It Out,1,"Given the aggressive treatments that some people pursue for chronic low back pain, it is important for journalists to report research that points to a benefit from non-surgical therapies as well. This isn’t the first study of massage for low back pain. Prior studies haven’t shown much benefit for low back pain that is less than 1 month in duration, but prior studies have shown benefit for those with pain for more than 3 months (chronic). As such these results aren’t breaking new ground. What it does show is that two forms of massage give similar results and that the benefits of massage in terms of pain diminish over time. Massage did show peristent improvement in function at 26 weeks. At 52 weeks function was better in the relaxation massage group but not the structural massage group when compared to usual care (though the direct comparison of the two massage groups didn’t significantly differ). In summary, this study adds to the evidence that massage provides short-term benefit for patients with chronic low back pain that diminishes over time in terms of pain, but maintains its benefit in terms of function. This is good news, but it isn’t a cure. Chronic low back pain is a common problem for which there is rarely a cure and for which many treatments appear to provide similar modest benefit but wtih very different risks and costs. Journalists join patients in the search for a cure, and the “dramatic” results reported appear to start us down that inaccurate slope. The story doesn’t say that the short-term benefits don’t all persist. But it does save itself by highlighting that the long-term benefit seen in the patient described may be as much attributable to treatment (exercise) she received after completing massage, as to the massage itself."
Partnership plans to build cancer treatment machine,1,"This story reads like a promotional vehicle for a new, potentially cost-prohibitive machine manufactured by TomoTherapy.

The story cites Dr. DeVere White and Dr. Matthews of UC Davis Cancer. Researchers at the Center helped finance and develop the proton therapy machines with TomoTherapy, Inc., so they have an interest in positively promoting their work. The story also cites a senior project manager at TomoTherapy, Inc., who also cannot provide unbiased information about this new device. The story needs balance, possibly from  interviews with cancer researchers (radiologists) and clinicians who could provide perspective on this emerging technology as cancer treatment. The story presents proton therapy as a newer, alternative option for shrinking tumors; however, this technology as cancer therapy is still in early development, though it has received FDA approval. The story gives us no data to support this newer option as better than existing methods of X-ray radiation treatment for cancer. The story does not mention that current forms of X-ray radiation can be targetted to a tumor via computer imaging and the use of devices (i.e. balloon, seeds, etc.) This sometimes reduces harm to healthy tissue. Despite company reassurances, we do not know if this form of therapy is as efficacious as current radiation or if it is safe. We are also not told if this therapy is only for a particular type of cancer or if it could be used on tumors anywhere in the body. Lastly, the story lists the cost of the machine but does not mention how this would influence treatment costs for the patient. We are not told if this method of cancer treatment would be covered by health insurance, or how the cost would compare to current radiation treatments. In short, the story needed more on costs, context, and evidence in comparison with existing alternatives. Independent perspectives were sorely needed."

MICHIGAN ATHLETIC GROUP SAYS CONCUSSION PROGRAM WORKS,1,"Concussions incurred during sporting events in middle and high schools may have substantial health impacts on young athletes. Recognition of those impacts has grown exponentially in the US, generating earnest efforts to find ways to diagnose possible problems during games, before an athlete returns to the fray and runs the risk of making things worse. A number of companies now market baseline testing products, which usually involve a “baseline” neurological exam at the start of the season. Later, if the athlete is injured during a game, a shorter “sideline” exam can be conducted to compare to the original exam. This AP story reports on a Michigan-based organization that made baseline testing available to schools in order to gather data over the course of a year about the frequency of potential concussions across ages, genders and type of sport. The story does a nice job of summarizing the results of that study but treats the concept of baseline testing uncritically. Can the brief sideline diagnostic efforts in the midst of a game actually detect a problem in the making? It depends on who you “ask.” Baseline testing is currently fashionable in medical circles. The Journal of the American Association (JAMA) has published articles concluding that baseline procedures are valid tests of cognitive function in athletes, a conclusion disputed by articles in other journals. The CDC has a webpage explaining baseline testing that offers details about when to do the tests but with no efficacy critique. And web pages from “The Sports Concussion Institute” tout the testing as evidence-based. But is it? We could find no controlled trials showing that neuropsychological testing improves outcomes after sports-related concussions. And that, in turn, may mean that baseline testing is still a form of expert opinion masquerading as evidence-based science. Since companies are selling baseline testing products, the possibility of industry influence on the conduct of research exists. These details were needed in the to story to present a full picture of what’s at stake. Sports-related head injuries are increasingly implicated in permanent brain damage. Determining their frequency and potential severity while there is still time to treat or, ideally, avoid the problem is critical."

Fighting addiction with a pill,0,"""This CBS News segment on the drug Suboxone (sublingual buprenorphine) explores the medication’s use as a way to treat addiction to prescription painkillers. Its key strength is its lucid explanation, using a video, of the physiology of addiction and the drug’s mechanism of action. But the piece falls far short of health journalism best practices in several significant ways. To illustrate the drug’s effectiveness it draws heavily on a single anecdote, which tells the story of a patient who appears to have an unusually successful outcome. It does not cite published research or interview independent sources to verify the drug’s safety and efficacy. It fails to identify the one physician interviewed as lead investigator in the current clinical trial. It implies the drug is new and novel, yet it has been approved for use as a drug addiction treatment for five years and is not widely used. It fails to explain that the current clinical trial is exploring whether Suboxone, used with counseling in people who are addicted to prescription painkillers, can help people withdraw from the painkillers in one phase and then taper fairly quickly off Suboxone. It fails to explain that the vast majority of patients who take Suboxone relapse, and that many of those who can stay off the drug to which they are addicted go onto long-term maintenance therapy with Suboxone. The story appears to draw heavily on an article appearing in the Fall 2007 issue of NYU Physician, a publication of the New York University School of Medicine and Hospital Centers, employer of study lead investigator Marc N. Gourevitch. The NYU Physician piece focuses on the story of Brian, the same man who is the focus of the CBS News segment. The CBS piece appears to adapt language from the magazine article. In one place the article reads:    The hope is that this will eventually do for drug addiction what SSRI’s like Prozac did for depression: convince both primary-care physicians and the public that addiction is a chronic brain disease, not a character flaw. The physician-reporter in the CBS piece says:  The hope is that one day Suboxone can do for painkiller addiction what drugs like Prozac did for depression: convince people that it’s more of a brain disease, not so much a character flaw. It is also worth pointing out that Brian, according to the NYU Physician article, has had an outcome more complex than viewers might believe. In the NYU article, Brian is quoted as saying that after his initial treatment with Suboxone, his withdrawl was """"the worst three weeks of my life,"""" with """"sleepless weeks of nausea, chills, diarrhea, apathy, and intense, uncontrolled cravings for opiates."""" The CBS segment about Brian did not include this information."""

Unlocking Puzzles Inside The Brain: ADHD,0,"""Brain imaging for neurological disorders is an exciting, fast-moving and very promising area of research. This segment (and a companion piece aired the day before on autism) reports on clinical application of MRIs and EEGs by a well qualified neurologist. Dr. Fernando Miranda’s clinical work puts him at the forefront of treatment for ADHD and other neurological conditions. But his work is also in some ways ahead of the research, which is inconclusive and still in early stages. He also operates a clinic that sells this service, creating a conflict of interest. The segment’s serious flaw is its failure to put Dr. Miranda’s work in the context of the research, which has been done for over a decade, funded by government agencies and published in top medical journals. The segment dwells on anecdotes suggesting benefit without really exploring the underlying questions: Does the science justify the treatment Miranda giving? What are his results aside from the anecdotal? What have other researchers and clinicians–those who do not operate for-profit clinics offering the service–found when using similar techniques? What are the objections of well-informed dissenters? The use of a single brief quote """"for"""" and one """"against"""" doesn’t illuminate any of the underlying issues. Having said all that, the report is commendable in two ways:  The reporter is careful, especially at the end, not to oversell the diagnostic approach, calling it one additional technique that can help with ADHD or other disorder diagnosis. The network provides a more detailed written version of this report on its web site–a broadcast journalism best practice. The question that dogs this piece is why the producers would choose to ignore all the important research being done in the field. One fears it’s to make the story appear more edgy, more of a breakthough, more of an exclusive. If so, it does not serve viewers well."""

Pain Patches Making Gains in U.S.,0,"The story does include some commentary from some independent sources, and it does a good job placing the patches into the larger context of pain-relief traditions in other countries. But it does not carefully analyze the evidence supporting the use of these patches, does not quantify the benefits of their use, does not quantify the harms and does not provide any cost information. We’re baffled as to why this story was published (twice – 6 months apart) and why so many outlets picked it up. (Yahoo, iVillage, MSN, ScienceMagNews, countless TV stations, etc. Just do a web search on the headline to see dozens and dozens of re-posts.) Old news that didn’t get better with time, and still spreads like wildfire! Pain management is one of the most difficult areas of medicine. Patients who are in pain understandably will try any number of measures to seek relief. Good physicians, including the ones quoted in this story, tend to take a cautious approach, attempting to manage pain treatment holistically to avoid turning a pain sufferer into a pain medicine addict. Stories about various pain relief methods need to make it clear why one method might be an advance over another and why some methods might work better for short-term pain sufferers versus chronic pain patients. This story did neither."

Both men have an extensive history of political and diplomatic service to their countries over the last thirty years: Mohammad Javad Zarif lived in and was educated (up to the PhD level) in the United States, served as a member of the Iranian delegation to the United Nations (a position in which he met with a number of Washington politicians), has been a headline speaker at foreign policy conferences in the U.S. (attended by prominent Washington politicians), and has been Iran’s minister of foreign affairs since 2013, while John Kerry served several terms in the U.S. Senate, was the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004, chaired the Senate’s Foreign Relations Committee, and has been U.S. Secretary of State since 2013.

"Test evaluates pregnancy, and it can deliver calm",1,"""Preterm labor occurs in 8 to 10 percent of all births. Despite various strategies to reduce this percentage, it has remained relatively stable. Diagnosing preterm birth is difficult and has a high false-positive rate. As a result, many women are needlessly hospitalized, miss work or restrict their activies. The fetal fibronectin test could potentially reduce the need for hospitalizations by more accurately diagnosing preterm labor and providing peace of mind to women. The story perpetuates fear of preterm birth among asymptomatic women by focusing on only a small part of the preterm labor population and by not distinguishing the risk of preterm labor in asymptomatic versus symptomatic women. The test is really intended for and is only useful in symptomatic women, not as a screening test in women without symptoms. Furthermore, the story does not comment on the strength of the available evidence to support the use of the test. Specifically, the story does not comment on whether we know if the use of the test will result in better outcomes, such as reduced hospitalizations or prevention of preterm birth. The story does not quantify the benefits of the test. The simple question, how many hospitlizations could be prevented?, is not answered. Finally, the story does not really comment on the harms, or potential harms of the test.

Foot wrap offers alternative to medication for patients with restless legs syndrome,0,"This news release about a foot wrap device to treat symptoms of restless leg syndrome tries to portray study results as newer, more novel and more distinctive than they really are. While the study was just published in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, the results were submitted to the FDA more than five years ago and the key findings have been used to market the device that was cleared for sale in 2013. Besides omitting the history of the study, the release promotes this foot wrap as if it were the only alternative to drug treatment, when there are other devices also on the market, as well as recommendations for massage, hot baths, lifestyle changes and other ways people can try to control bothersome leg movements. The release would have been stronger had it noted that the device is already on the market, and at what cost. More details on the trial results, including limitations, as found in the published study, would also have been useful. Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a common but poorly understood neurological condition that leads to discomfort in the lower legs. For most individuals, the symptoms are mild and mainly impact sleep. For those with more severe symptoms, the discomfort in the legs can also be bothersome during the day. More than nine million people in the US may be dealing with moderate to severe RLS. Several times that many have milder symptoms or similar conditions they may confuse for RLS. That means that many millions of people may be misled by a news release that misstates the novelty of a foot wrap device and the study being used to promote it. The potential for confusion is demonstrated by the number of news organizations that apparently believed these study results are new, when they’ve been circulating for years and used in product marketing since at least early 2015."

Acknowledged in the release as “controversial” and in direct opposition to the recommendations of the American Psychiatric Association, the use of ketamine can improve depression symptoms with six infusions or less, according to the release. The news release is thin on the kinds of facts we look for to support assertions about a drug’s safety and efficacy. It doesn’t address cost, benefit data or harms. It touts the putative benefits of a treatment that has not been approved by federal health authorities as either safe or effective, and it offers little evidence to support its use. It makes no mention of randomized trials in terms of real data–the only way one can tell if a treatment is really of benefit. Depression affects some 350 million people globally, according to the World Health Organization, and represents the leading cause of disability. Although effective treatments exist for depression, they do not always work. A new weapon in the armamentarium of health professionals might reduce the impact of depression, which can lead to suicide. Standard anti-depressant medication and therapy generally take a month or more to help, and it would be great to have something with a quicker onset on action as ketamine purportedly has."

Where Trump misses the mark is his suggestion that the drop in prosecutions is to blame for the opioid epidemic, which started before Obama’s tenure and then grew worse during his presidency. Obama could have done more earlier to address the epidemic, experts said, but there is no evidence that his strategy on federal drug prosecutions led to a spike in opioid overdose deaths."""

But do these programs have any downsides and what do they cost? Readers would have benefited from hearing those specifics, but the omissions are relatively minor considering the broad scope of the coverage.

New study finds that proton therapy has fewer side effects in esophageal cancer patients,0,"Treatment room at the Maryland Proton Treatment Center. Proton therapy has been shown to be a significant improvement over other forms of radiation therapy for a select group of conditions including: intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs); ocular tumors, including intraocular/uveal melanoma; and skull-based tumors (e.g., chordomas or chondrosarcomas). Its value in other tumor types and conditions has not been demonstrated in a randomized clinical trial. The University of Maryland (UMD) release claims that proton therapy, also known as proton beam therapy, causes fewer toxic side effects when used to treat esophageal cancer patients. However, that’s about all we learn from this news release. The release doesn’t touch on many important questions, such as how many fewer side effects proton beam therapy causes, whether those side effects actually reduce health risk for patients, or whether proton therapy is more effective at treating the cancer. The release also doesn’t address cost or even describe the study that forms the basis for the claims. The National Cancer Institute reports that more than 35,000 people in the United States were living with esophageal cancer in 2012. Radiation therapy to treat cancer can cause a wide array of negative side effects, which can affect both quality of life and long-term health. Anything that can be done to limit those side effects is worth covering. But there’s another reason to pay close attention to emerging research on proton therapy: money. According to a Wall Street Journal article published May 26, 16 proton therapy centers are under construction in the United States — at a cost of up to $200 million each. That’s on top of more than a dozen such centers that have already been built. However, there are a lot of questions about whether proton therapy offers better health outcomes than other radiation therapy techniques. Or, as a 2014 article in Modern Healthcare put it, “Hospitals investing in proton-beam radiation therapy centers are gambling on clinical evidence that is still years away to justify their plunge into the expensive technology.” HealthNewsReview has written about proton therapy at length, and for good reason: an unproven treatment technique that involves human lives, human health, and billions of dollars in industry investment is a subject worth following."

"Marijuana legalization could help offset opioid epidemic, studies find",1,"Health professionals—from doctors to policy experts—are exploring strategies for controlling the opioid crisis gripping the U.S. Advocates for legalizing marijuana for medical or recreational purposes have suggested that increased access to marijuana could curb opioid use. The two studies published in JAMA Internal Medicine discussed in this CNN article found that state legalization of medical marijuana was associated with a decrease in opioid prescriptions. But before it presented the data, the article led readers to believe the study findings “suggest that there is merit” in “using medical marijuana to help Americans struggling with opioid addiction,”—which is beyond what the studies could possibly show. The article took another misstep when it stated that the researchers analyzed opioid prescriptions to “evaluate whether medical marijuana could function as an effective and safe alternative to opioids.” The data the researchers looked at could not answer that question. These were not clinical trials comparing pain relief from marijuana with pain relief from opioids in patients who would typically be prescribed opioids. They were analyses of data on opioid prescriptions in Medicaid and Medicare databases. The researchers detail the limitations of their studies, as does a commentary published along with them. But only one limitation made it into the article: the caveat that the results may not be generalizable to the entire U.S. population because they only used data on patients enrolled in Medicare and Medicare Part D. The biggest limitation goes unmentioned: There was no way to know if anyone was actually choosing to use marijuana instead of opioids. The article addressed two hot button topics: opioid addiction and the legalization of marijuana. Ninety people in the U.S. die each day from an opioid overdose, and families and friends of individuals struggling with opioid addiction are searching for ways to help their loved ones. It’s easy to find anecdotal stories online from people who say marijuana helped curb their withdrawal symptoms, but whether marijuana helps people overcome opioid addiction or can be used instead of opioids to ease pain cannot be answered in studies such as these."

Roche's Pricey New Breast-Cancer Combo Barely Beats Old Drug,2,"The latest result on Roche’s new combo therapy for breast cancer occurs as a disappointment to investors, though it is one that’s unsurprising to medical researchers. This Bloomberg article receives high marks for reporting the cost, harms and perhaps negligible benefit of the new treatment which combines a newer drug (Perjeta) with an older drug (Herceptin). The story is balanced with its inclusion of the more optimistic side of the news. Roche plans to track the new therapy for years to come to determine if the currently observed small improvement will accentuate over time. This is a notable endeavor since the long-term effect and safety of a cancer treatment is nearly as important as its immediate potency.

The study found that those who drank five or more cups of green tea daily had a significantly lower risk of dying of heart disease, but not of dying from cancer. The story does a good job of describing the latest study as well as other studies that have shown conflicting results. The story also provides needed balance by quoting multiple independent experts. The major flaw of the story is in the quantification of benefits. The story quantifies the benefits in relative terms only. The story should have provided more context for these numbers. For example, the story does not explain that, in spite of the large number of participants in the study, the actual number of deaths was very small. The rate of heart disease mortality was only between 2 and 3% (depending on gender) among non-tea drinkers. Reducing this rate by 20 to 30% by drinking 5 or more cups of green tea daily is a better way to look at the same numbers."

Fecal transplant via a pill? Newsweek’s coverage points out possible selection bias of study participants,2,"This Newsweek story reports on the results of a small study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study compared two methods of delivering a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), via a colonoscopy or with an oral pill, to treat Clostridium difficile infection. An FMT involves taking feces from a healthy person and transplanting it into a sick person, to see if that can help eradicate unwanted microbes. Both approaches were equally successful and the oral pill — as might be expected — was perceived as less objectionable by patients. The story covers most of the bases we require, though it was unclear on the availability of the pill-based treatment, and what role standard antibiotics play in treatment and research outcomes. As the story points out, Clostridium difficile infections in hospital patients is a serious public health problem, infecting “half a million people in the United States per year and killing 15,000 people” annually. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is fast becoming the treatment of choice in these cases and any improvement to facilitate this approach would obviously be welcome. The pill approach diminishes the “yuck factor” with this treatment, based on the study results."
Organ-On-Chip Could Revolutionize Drug Testing,1,"Will new technology reduce the need for animal testing? This Newsweek story addresses an important topic with plenty of research and reporting. It tells how new chip-based technology that models human organs could potentially replace animal studies as a means of testing new drug candidates — possibly leading to cheaper and faster approvals. But while there’s a reasonable exploration of the evidence and some caution about the early state of the technology, the story feels unbalanced. The story only quotes researchers with a vested interest in the success of the technology, and its language describing potential benefits gets a little ahead of the evidence in places. Inclusion of an independent source with expertise in this area probably would have helped with many of these concerns. We make some other suggestions for improvement below in our review comments. Many non-profit organizations call for the end of animal experimentation, which is a controversial topic around the world. In addition, a common refrain from companies and researchers developing novel agents is the time and capital required to take a therapeutic from conceptualization to testing in non-animal then animal and finally human subjects. It is recognized that we need better experimental systems to identify new therapeutics and test their effectiveness and safety before trying them in human subjects. So it is welcome to see novel systems being designed that may do a better job. However exciting such new technology may be, this article presents an optimistic picture that is not fully supported by evidence. While we can hope that this will represent a better way to screen therapeutics for human studies, we can’t yet say that there is evidence that this is safer, less costly, or that it better identifies successful agents."
HPV Shot Prevents Genital Warts in Boys and Men,1,"This story shows many strengths, and wisely sets a single research report from the New England Journal of Medicine inside a larger debate about whether thousands of young men should receive the costly vaccine Gardasil. The story wades into discussions of sexual orientation and even at what age an individual knows this truth about him or herself. These difficult topics are germane to the epidemiology of the many human papillomaviruses, and which people of both sexes are at highest risk from infection. Bravo for reading the editorial that accompanied the study article, and chasing down its author on deadline to get her comments. Bravo for asking “why” when confronted with the seemingly contradictory news that Gardasil can prevent genital warts but is not recommended by the CDC for universal prevention in young men. Since Gardasil (and competitor, Cervarix) debuted a few years ago, there have been heated disagreements about the price and most helpful distribution of the vaccines and whether both sexes should receive them. This major study, demonstrating effectiveness in young men, adds important information to complex questions of cost and prevention. But it needs to be reported in a way that provides some of the history and context for readers. HPV infection is transmitted sexually, so questions of prevention within the entire US population of men and women involve potentially vaccinating both sexes. However, both sexes are not at the same level of risk for potentially deadly cancers years later. Women bear the brunt of the health risks, but men can pass the infection to their partners and can suffer from cancerous and non-cancerous effects of the virus. This new study provides additional information for the ongoing discussion about the public health role of immunizing young men against HPV."

Experimental procedure aimed at repairing spinal cord shows promise,0,"This story portrays a quadriplegic man who believes a stem cell transplant helped him to recover partial function after a spinal cord injury. The story effectively conveys the devastation of spinal cord injuries and correctly identifies stem cell therapy as an experimental and unproven treatment. However, its thrust that the therapy “shows promise” is misleading; its efficacy has yet to be supported by rigorous trials. The story doesn’t give data on costs, harms, and availability that might have injected balance into the piece. We’ve reviewed other stories that unfairly wow readers up front only to save caveats for the end, including a recent BuzzFeed piece on an experimental device that restored some function to a paralysis patient. But in this case, the story also perpetuates a trend of media coverage that hypes unproven stem cell therapies for various conditions, unfairly raising patient expectations based on isolated and preliminary findings. About 282,000 people in the U.S. are estimated to be living with spinal cord injuries, mainly from vehicle collisions and falls, according to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center. Spinal cord injuries can be incomplete, meaning that patients retain some motor or sensory function below the injury, or complete, in which there is a total lack of sensory and motor function below the level of injury. In either case, they almost always result in lifelong disability. Effective emergency care for people with spinal cord injuries and aggressive treatment and rehabilitation can minimize damage to the nervous system and restore some function. However, there is no treatment to repair spinal cord injuries. Stem cells are an active area of research for spinal cord repair, but their potential and associated risks are not clear. According to the Canadian Stem Cell Foundation, stem cells are being studied as a source of new cells and products that could prevent further damage, restore nerve function, generate new nerve cells and guide the regrowth of severed nerve fibers. It says current trials are very small, mostly testing the safety of putting adult stem cells into patients. The question of whether stem cells can safely improve function is years away from being answered. Meanwhile, there’s growing concern about media reports that exaggerate the potential of stem cell therapies that are in early phases of research. This month the International Society for Stem Cell Research issued guidelines to encourage accurate and balanced communication of stem cell science, including setbacks as well as progress."

Research: Healthy diet cuts risk of Alzheimer’s,0,"This article provided only cursory information about a study that adds to the existing literature about dietary interventions for Alzheimers prevention.

The story said that said that “People who followed the diet were up to 40 percent less likely than those who largely avoided it to develop Alzheimer’s during the course of the research.” The story shouldn’t make the reader do the math to figure out the absolute risk reduction between the groups. See the importance of “absolute vs. relative risks,” explained in a link by that name on the home page under “Things You Should Know About Research Stories.” The story didn’t explain how or if the researchers monitored adherence to the diet during the trial. It would be useful to provide additional context (even from quotes from experts in the field) so that readers can better evaluate the evidence as they consider making dietary changes. Comparisons between benefits from dietary changes and those beneftis from other preventive strategies would also be helpful in putting this into context."

SWEAT IT OUT! SKIN PATCH AIMS TO TEST SWEAT FOR HEALTH,0,"This story covers a study on the accuracy and durability of a microfluidic skin patch that collects sweat and analyzes it with the help of a smartphone. Researchers found the device detected lactate, glucose, and chloride ion concentrations as well as sweat pH while sticking to the skin of 21 athletes during a controlled cycling test. The story rightly cautions that the technology is “experimental” and notes that additional research is needed before it can be used for health monitoring. But if that’s the case, it’s not clear why this is newsworthy. There are no interviews with medical experts that might help readers understand whether this technology has viable clinical applications. Also, the story doesn’t discuss costs, potential harms, or the researchers’ commercial ties. Wearable technology presents a huge business opportunity, but health benefits can be elusive. Take a recently published study of 471 young adults that showed carrying technology such as a Fitbit to monitor diet and physical activity did not help with weight loss and in fact might have hindered it. Researchers speculated that activity trackers might actually shift a person’s focus from individual behavior to technology and ultimately reduce motivation. When it comes to sweat, there’s evidence it contains some valuable health data. For example, sweat tests are used to confirm a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in infants. But it’s far from clear that real-time sweat monitoring is superior to existing tools when it comes to screening for health conditions or helping endurance athletes avoid an electrolyte imbalance. Still, there’s money to be made in the athletic market, and it’s not surprising that patch developers are going after it. Even if this technology does prove effective, which is a big if, the ultimate question may be whether the data turns out to benefit athletes or act as a pernicious distraction."

Drugs that activate brain stem cells may reverse multiple sclerosis,2,"Our review team had a lively debate as to the extent to which this National Institutes of Health news release exaggerates the findings of the study it reports on. We agreed that the release waits far too long to warn readers that this exciting study of potential multiple sclerosis drugs was conducted in petri dishes and mice. One has to read through more than half of the release before that crucial caveat is introduced. But we had mixed opinions about the headline, “Drugs that activate brain stem cells may reverse multiple sclerosis.” Some of us felt this was misleading because readers would assume the release is talking about human disease, and there’s nothing in the release or the underlying study to support a “reversal” of disease in humans. The opposing view is that the headline accurately reflects what happened in the study in mice and is therefore not an exaggeration. According to this view, the release is deficient mainly because it failed to qualify that the findings were from mice in a timely manner (ideally the first paragraph), but not because of the headline. We welcome reader perspectives on this debate in the comments. The lackluster performance of the pharmaceutical industry in developing new treatments has led to coordinated efforts to repurpose existing drugs for new uses. The research highlighted in this NIH news release is important because it represents one of the earliest examples for this new form of drug development. Multiple sclerosis can be a devastating disease causing significant dysfunction and early death in some patients. Treatments at the moment consist of drugs that target the immune system. While effective, they come with a host of side effects and are very costly. The approach highlighted here provides a potentially new avenue of attack: promoting myelin repair. With that said, this is very early in the game and the drugs — clobetasol and miconazole — have only been shown to work in the test tube and in a mouse model. As we have said on many occasions, success in the mouse model is just that: success in the mouse model."
3-D breast scan seen as breakthrough,2,"We are pleased when we see a major newspaper willing to devote 1300 words to an important story about breast cancer screening. This in-depth Philadelphia Enquirer piece about a new 3-D mammogram puts the extra column space to reasonably good use, but it could have done better. Importantly, it zeroes in on the likely benefit of the new technology — reducing false positive screens — and explains that the test will not help us solve the larger problem of determining which cancers need to be aggressively treated and which ones don’t. But there was room in this article to include some truly independent voices, which this story did not seek out. There could have been a better characterization of costs, too. We also wanted to see more detail about the harms of the new test, as well as the studies that formed the basis for the FDA approval of the device. Readers should also be informed of the expected availability of this new test, which was vaguely described. Screening for breast cancer remains an important public health issue given the prevalence of the disease and the fact that cancers detected earlier are easier to treat. The problem of false positive testing in mammography is a big one, and new technology to improve this rate will have direct patient benefit. As the story points out, the inaccuracy of 2-D mammography leads to many women undergoing follow-up X-rays and biopsies that cause significant anxiety. The new 3-D test will be valuable if it can reduce the need for that extra testing, but we should be aware that finding more cancer may mean more treatment of tumors that would never cause a problem. There is a pressing need for tests that distinguish the aggressive cancers from the slow-growing ones."

High doses of vitamin D rapidly reduce arterial stiffness,1,"Getty Images With just a few tweaks, this could have been a stellar release on a small study about the benefits of high doses of vitamin D on arterial stiffness. Arterial stiffness is a cause of atherosclerosis, a  thickening and stiffening of the arterial wall, and is related to high blood pressure or hypertension. The release presents many of the necessary caveats, avoids disease mongering and unjustifiable language, and does a nice job describing what the researchers did to reach their conclusions. The release also does readers a service by explaining a relatively complex topic in terms that regular readers (and journalists) can understand. The actual number of people who saw a benefit is missing, though, as is any mention of harms, any mention of other treatments for arterial stiffness, and any mention of how the study was funded or whether there were any conflicts of interest. We gave the release three stars because we felt these were mostly benign omissions. But, in the interest of keeping a high standard for writing strong scientific news releases, we make note of the omissions where they occurred. The benefits of daily supplement vitamins are under more scrutiny than ever because of repeated large scale studies that show minimal if any health effects. This raises the bar for researchers wanting to present a persuasive case for the benefits of vitamin D or any other vitamin."

"Study Finds Single, Escalated Dose of Brachytherapy Radiation May Be a Safe and Effective Treatment for Localized Prostate Cancer",0,"This news release from a professional society of radiation oncologists summarizes a trial in 58 men with Stage 1 localized prostate cancer that found using a single treatment of high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (where radioactive implants are inserted directly into the tissue) may be an acceptable and safe alternative to typical longer, but lower doses of radiation. Recognizing that a higher dose, single radiation treatment could be more toxic to tissues surrounding the prostate, this trial set out to measure the effectiveness and safety of such treatment. While the research was non-randomized, its generally positive tone was balanced by emphasizing that there needs to be additional follow-up research to see how it compares with conventional approaches. After stating in the headline the treatment “may be safe and effective,” the release provides a fairly detailed description of harms. A concern with this study is that nearly all of the patient volunteers would have been candidates for active surveillance–meaning that they did not need an active treatment. With no caveat that expert guidelines recommend surveillance for low-risk Stage 1 prostate cancers, this release engages in disease-mongering. It is recognized that exposure to radioactive treatments can be harmful and so finding other ways to treat tumors in the prostate should be welcomed. If a treatment for localized prostate cancer which is administered in a single procedure, is equally effective and safe as conventional treatment, it is possible that patients may have fewer side effects and adverse events related to their prostate cancer treatment. This study provides some data on the safety and tolerability of the single dose of 19 Gy HDR brachytherapy compared to LDR brachytherapy,  It is important to note that these patients were a very select sample of prostate cancer patients (low to intermediate risk) and so extrapolating those findings to other prostate cancer patients may not be appropriate."

The broadcast gives no airtime to skeptics, independent researchers and patients with poor outcomes. The result is an excessively positive, one-sided piece. This is a shame. The fact that gastric bypass appears to reduce risk of diabetes independent of weight loss is credibly documented and a subject of continued independent research. It has produced new insights into the mechanism of the disease. The surgery may indeed become a more widespread treatment for severe and moderate obesity and its associated risks, such as diabetes and hypertension. But by piling on exclusively positive anecdotes, and devoting so much airtime to supporters at the expense of independent sources and skeptics, the piece loses credibility. An important medical story is buried by a mound of hype. A more balanced story would have incorporated information about the limitation of studies to date and opinions from doctors who are doing research on the safety of the procedure. This is one case where our ratings criteria may have allowed for a deceptively-high four-star score."

New class of drugs could help tackle treatment-resistant cancers,0,"This news release touts a “new class of drug” that is being tested to treat cancers that are resistant to other therapies. The news release says the initial research was funded by the charity Cancer Research UK and the drug was licensed to Irish biotechnology firm Carrick Therapeutics, which is has begun conducting a safety study. Laudably, the headline and the body of the news release caution that this isn’t a proven treatment. But there’s far more hype here than substance. The news release lauds researchers for quick action and offers a quote about how “exciting” it is that academia and industry “are bringing urgently needed new tests and treatments to patients.” But there’s no mention that Imperial College London has a patent on this drug. There’s also no discussion of how many patients might benefit from this, or acknowledgement of the extremely high prices for new cancer drugs. The high cost of new cancer drugs, some of which offer only marginal benefits, is strangling healthcare budgets around the world even though initial research is often funded by government agencies and charities. New releases and news stories should not only describe clinical benefits, but also explore the financial deals under which these drugs are developed, and tell the public which companies, institutions, and clinicians stand to profit from them."
A Genetic Test for Prospective Parents,1,"""This Wall Street Journal story hits many of the right marks when describing a test created by a Silicon Valley start-up, Counsyl Inc., that allows prospective parents to determine  whether they carry genes that could lead to their children having specific hereditary diseases. Such tests have been available previously. The news here is that this company’s innovation makes testing far cheaper and easier. The Journal found the test so remarkable it gave it a Bronze award as part of its annual awards for technology innovation. We did not find the story about the test quite as remarkable, mainly because it did not thoroughly explain the evidence behind this advance and the risks involved with genetic screening. The story itself makes it clear why a better genetic test — and careful coverage of the test — matter. """"Proponents of universal prepregnancy genetic screening make a bold claim: If these tests were widely available, they could significantly reduce, and possibly eliminate, hereditary diseases."""" To test that bold claim, stories like these need to provide more of the evidence to readers in easy to understand terms. If the test can help individuals considering having children who may be at high risk for a genetic defect, it does not mean that it will help an individual who is worried about genetic defects, but not at high risk. The reason is that as the likelihood that the person has a genetic defect falls, the ability of the test to differentiate between a false positive and a true positive gets harder. False alarms for prospective parents could be devastating. There isn’t even the briefest mention of this incredibly important issue."""

"Sugar Is Definitely Toxic, a New Study Says",2,"This news story reports that a diet study, conducted on 43 overweight minority children and teenagers, is believed by the researchers who did it to definitively prove that sugar — in and of itself — is metabolically toxic regardless of how much or little of it is eaten, and irrespective of the weight of the eaters. It does a solid job of describing the design of the study and discussing why the evidence it provides is qualitatively different from previous research. But we thought the framing of the story was off kilter, as it leads with lots of glowing discussion about the strength and importance of the research, while putting important caveats and limitations far down in the piece. We also think the story could have been more thorough in its discussion of those limitations — including the fact that 43 is a small number of participants, the study was very short in duration, and it had no control group. But while there was room for improvement, readers who make it to the end of the piece should come away with a reasonably thorough understanding of the study’s findings and what they might mean. It’s hard to imagine that any American family could be completely uninformed about the health-related risks of consuming high fructose corn syrup and table sugar (sucrose), major components of sweet drinks, and a supermarket full of processed foods. But as the article points out, it has been difficult to design studies that show that such “added sugar” is an independent toxic substance even when total calories and weight stay the same. That difficulty, in turn, has made it hard to say with certainty whether people who reduced their sugar consumption and were improving their metabolic health (e.g. blood pressure, liver function, cholesterol levels, fat accumulation in the abdominal region) were getting the benefit from less sugar or from fewer overall calories. Given the growing rates of diabetes, fatty liver disease and heart disease in ever-younger populations, adding to evidence that not all calories are equal in harm or benefit is more than welcome by physicians and parents. And studies like this one to add to a growing body of evidence that restricting sugar may be good public health policy. If additional studies, longer in duration and larger in scope are done, this could result in policy change that may help keep everyone healthier."
KETAMINE SHOWS PROMISE AS TREATMENT FOR ADOLESCENTS WITH DEPRESSION,1,"This story reported on a preliminary study looking at whether the drug ketamine might be a potential treatment for adolescent depression. The story refrained from disease-mongering and quantified the scope of the observed benefits. However, the headline and lead were misleading in stating that teens who took the drug had improvements in their depression. The word “promise” used in the headline wasn’t borne out by the data. In fact, the study wasn’t designed to offer reliable evidence that the drug offers a benefit. Caveats about the study were included only toward the end of the story, and readers were left in the dark about ketamine’s potential for misuse and its potential side effects. Costs were also missing. Adolescent depression is a widespread problem, and a substantial number of adolescents don’t respond successfully to drugs that are currently available. Given high public interest in an effective alternative, news reports should refrain from encouraging false hopes when it comes to early-stage research. That means emphasizing appropriate caveats with the quality of evidence and refraining from making claims that aren’t borne out by the data. In addition, potential harms should be spelled out, particularly when it comes to the unknown effects of long-term use on developing brains and bodies."

Contemporaneous reports estimated that 1,000 people were in attendance at the Bataclan on 13 November 2015 with 700 of them were physically unharmed. Had the French government opted to cover up acts of torture and emasculation at the venue, there was nothing stopping the vast majority of surviving witnesses from sharing their stories. None did."

FDA Approves First Drug To Prevent Preterm Births,2,"Given that 50% of care is covered by Medicaid and 49% by private payors, the costs for this drug are invisible to the individual.

News of new drug approvals can be washed over with giddy hype. But not in this story, which offered perspective, context and restraint."
Routine screenings prevent cervical cancer in elderly women,1,"[Editor’s Note: The University of Illinois has updated its news release on this study to address some of our criticisms. The revised release, which can be accessed here, features a new headline and a more extensive discussion of the study’s methods and limitations. The original release that we reviewed has been archived and is accessible here or from the “Read Original Release” link above.] This release reports on a study that analyzed the Medicare billing records of elderly women diagnosed with cervical cancer during the 1990s and a matched control group of non-cancer patients — 1,200 patient records in all. It attempts to find a link between screening for cancer past age 65 and a reduced risk of cervical cancer. It states that women past 65 who continued to be screened by pap smears showed a reduced risk of cervical cancer, but it offers no information about the degree of risk reduction. Nor does it address concerns over possible harms from the screening or the cost of screening for women who are now told the screening is unnecessary because of their age. The headline claims a causal link that the study design cannot prove. If this research showed that women who are now told not to get pap smears as a screening for possible cervical cancer should actually continue being screened beyond age 65, then that would be an important public health change. Unfortunately, the release offered little detail to support that claim. Screening is not a harmless activity and while it is invaluable in some cases for some patients, screening is not always beneficial. Stories and releases that suggest that are not serving the public well."

Glaucoma Drug-Dispensing Eye Insert Shows Promise as New Option for Patients Struggling to Take Daily Prescription Eye Drops,2,"This news release reports phase 2 trial results of a silicone ring that slowly releases glaucoma medication onto the surface of the eye, potentially eliminating the need for patients to self-administer eye drops. The study was funded by the developer of the device, ForSight VISION5, and appeared in Ophthalmology, the journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Glaucoma medications work by reducing internal fluid pressure that could permanently damage the optic nerve, resulting in vision loss. This randomized controlled trial of 130 patients, 64 of whom were given a medicated ring dispensing the drug bimatroprost along with artificial tears, showed the device lowered eye pressure in glaucoma patients by about 20 percent over six months. We found the news release adequately addresses potential harms and conflicts of interest, but could have done a better job discussing costs, study limitations, and alternative approaches to improve treatment delivery. Patient non-adherence to glaucoma treatment regimens is a serious problem, believed to contribute to glaucoma remaining a leading cause of blindness. Medication to lower eye pressure is generally preferred over traditional surgery and laser surgery because it has fewer risks and lower costs. But many patients fail to take daily eye drops for a variety of reasons including side effects, lack of understanding about the disease, and physical difficulties. These roadblocks are compounded in older patients who have physical and cognitive impairments. Consistent treatment is critical because even short periods without medication can result in vision loss. A number of strategies have been recommended to increase patient adherence including simplifying drug regimens and improving patient communication. There’s urgency to improve treatment options. From 2010 to 2050, the number of people in the U.S. with glaucoma is expected to increase by more than double, from 2.7 million to 6.3 million, according to the National Eye Institute."

New treatment for advanced melanoma shrinks tumors,0,"To its credit, this story does inject some caution into its coverage of a new treatment for advanced melanoma. Nevertheless, we think it is important to emphasize that the research being discussed was a phase 1 study that had only 32 patients in the arm that was reported on. The primary objective of this study was to ascertain the most effective dose that was tolerable to patients–it wasn’t designed to test whether this treatment is clinically effective for melanoma treatment. So while we can understand the excitement about the apparent benefits that were observed, we think it is critical to balance the discussion with extensive caveats about limitations and potential harms. This story didn’t come quite as close as we’d like to meeting that standard. Advanced melanoma is a disease which often kills patients within a year of diagnosis. We need better options to treat it."

Treating pain without feeding addiction: Study shows promise of non-drug pain management,1,"The release focuses on a recently published journal article that reported patients with chronic pain who are fighting drug addiction can reduce their pain using an approach called Improving Pain during Addiction Treatment (ImPAT). The release notes that the intensity of pain decreased, alcohol use decreased, and ability to function increased, for patients participating in ImPAT when compared to patients who participated only in conventional support groups. Rates of drug use were approximately the same for both groups. While the release does a good job of explaining why non-drug therapies are important for patients with chronic pain and a history of addiction, it does not meet our standard for telling readers the scope of benefit of ImPAT therapy as measured in the study — what degree of benefit in what percentage of those studied. Chronic pain is a serious and widespread problem. According to the National Institutes of Health, approximately one in every four Americans has suffered from pain that lasts longer than 24 hours, and chronic pain is the most common cause of long-term disability. And, according to Senate testimony from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, “an estimated 2.1 million people in the United States suffer[ed] from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers,” as of 2012. This tells us that many people who are suffering from chronic pain may also be suffering from substance abuse disorders that make it difficult to treat their pain using conventional painkillers. Given that effect that both chronic pain and addiction can have on both health and quality of life, this is a significant problem. New treatment approaches that can begin to address this problem in a meaningful way are certainly important. That includes quantifying the benefits of new treatments, such as ImPAT, so that doctors and patients can have a better understanding of how much such approaches may be able to help."
Some people have eschewed retirement homes in favor of living on cruise ships.,2,"Also, life on a cruise ship means one acquaintance after another, but no permanent ongoing connections of any depth. Fellow passengers disembark to return to their regular lives at the termination of their one- or two-week holidays, which means friendships struck up with them land in the “We’ll keep in touch” bin very quickly. As for staff, while serial cruisers can strike up deeply affable relationships with some of the line’s employees, these rapports are inherently limited by their very nature: no matter how close such associations appear to be, ships’ employees are required to be deferential to paying passengers, so the friendship-critical element of honesty can never be part of such dealings. Making a cruise ship one’s permanent address, therefore, will not be for everyone. While those at ease with a steady diet of the superficial will thrive, those who require the comfort of at least a few real friendships will likely feel lonely even though they live among crowds."

FDA OKs new drug to treat all forms of hepatitis C,1,"This AP story on the latest hepatitis C drug was strong on one point that’s often weak in health care news reporting: The price of treatment. But, it missed the opportunity to go beyond a standard quick report on the new drug, known as Mavyret, and give readers the kind of context that will help them make more informed decisions. For example, missing was a description of the type of research that was done, so patients could have a better sense of the strength of the results reported–as well as the limitations. Additionally, perspectives from a scientist or physician unaffiliated with the drug company would have made this article much more balanced. Most importantly, we think stories like this need to be far more cautious when using the word “cure” to describe a reduction in measurable viral levels in a person. Despite lowering the viral load, it remains to be seen if this drug–and many others like it–actually lower the rate of liver cancer, cirrhosis or early death. A flurry of new drugs have been developed for hepatitis C in the past few years. While this may seem like good news for patients, many of these drugs are expensive and their long-term benefit to patients remain unknown (such as: Do they actually prevent liver cancer or cirrhosis?)"

Multiple Studies Show Freespira® Eliminates Panic Attacks in 80% of Patients,0,"This news release claims that 80% of patients with panic attacks due to anxiety could get relief after 4 weeks of using a biofeedback device and training package known as Freespira. The device includes a sensor to measure carbon dioxide in the breath of a patient, and a tablet computer and an app to help them understand and change their breathing and potentially avoid panic attacks. The Freespira system is FDA cleared to market to patients for at-home use with physician guidance. But the release does not give us the date or publication of corroborating studies and simply says there was a presentation at a conference about these results. We are left unable to judge the news value of the latest study from such scant details. To our knowledge, the most recent study about this biofeedback device was published a year ago. Anxiety disorders are very common in the United States. The National Institutes of Mental Health estimates that almost one-third of adults will experience this once in a lifetime. But the release does not give readers enough information to judge whether there is new proof of effectiveness from a just completed research study, or whether this announcement is referencing old studies in a conference presentation. Note: We reviewed a story in 2015 about this same device and reviewers then had some similar concerns about the evidence surrounding the device, but found the author did a responsible job reporting on the device."

Novel imaging technique improves prostate cancer detection,0,"This news release is about a new method of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for use in the diagnosis and guiding of treatment for prostate cancer. The release claims that the new technique “measurably improves upon current prostate imaging,”  is “more reliable” than existing techniques, and “provides a better target for biopsies.” No data are provided to support any of these assertions, and the original study that sparked the release included just 27 patients and should be considered highly preliminary. Even the title of that study calls the results merely a “proof of principle.” [Editor’s note: This review was completed in January while we were still developing and honing this news releases review service. Although it’s a few months old, this review contains valuable information for those who write and consume health-related news releases, which is why we’re still publishing it.] Prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in men. However, some prostate tumors, even if malignant, may be slow growing and warrant nothing more than watching. If this new MRI method can help identify low-risk tumors, or assess the likelihood that a tumor will spread beyond the prostate, it would be a useful tool for guiding treatment. But the release doesn’t offer any data to show that this technique performs better than existing assessment approaches, and so its ability to justify a role for this new technology in prostate cancer treatment is extremely limited."
New migraine cure? Forehead lift surgery helps patients,0,"This story suggests there may be a miracle cure for migraine headaches that has yet to make its way into the evidence base of the American Academy of Neurology 2007 guidelines on migraine headache. The newscast includes a brief interview with a single patient whose debilitating migraines (“something of a nightmare”) responded to no previous treatment, but disappeared after she had a forehead lift. (“It was a gift. And it gave me my life back.”) It also features a single expert, a plastic surgeon who performs facelifts and is the lead author of a recent randomized trial comparing plastic surgery to sham surgery for migraine. The news story cites the surgeon’s study as evidence, but leaves out important details. Fully 35% of people who received surgery had complications–including “a slight degree of temple hollowing,” intense itching, persistent forehead numbness and neck stiffness, “slight asymmetric eyebrow movement,” and temporary hair loss or thinning—but the newscast ignores these. It also fails to note an intriguing placebo effect in the trial—people also improved if they received sham surgery for migraines. Why is that? Other questions remain unanswered: Is it possible to reliably select people for this procedure—a process that requires an expert to identify a single or predominant trigger site for patients’ migraines? Is it possible to truly blind people to a treatment that includes a forehead lift? What does the procedure cost? Why doesn’t it eliminate headaches in the other 43% who get facelifts? Aren’t there other treatments we should know about—including lifestyle changes, physical and psychological treatments, and first-line migraine-specific drugs (see “Treatment Options”)? To our eye, it seems likely the report will send migraine sufferers running to plastic surgeons for facelifts, despite its (slightly disingenuous?) claim to the contrary."
Smart air quality device and app helps you breathe easier,0,"The story describes a device and related mobile app, called Awair, that monitors air quality in the home and reports the information to users. The story offers little information about how the device could actually benefit users. More importantly, the story makes the air in our homes sound positively terrifying, using language that seems aimed at making homeowners scared of everything from dust to dirty carpets. The lack of quantified benefits — or any information about how accurate the device is — make this story read more like a paid promotion than a news article. Journalism is more than simply reciting facts. Reporters should ask questions, talk to independent sources, and help readers understand why (or if) something might be important to them. Reporters need to be skeptical critical thinkers, filtering through a sea of information before passing information on to readers in a context that helps the reader understand what’s going on. This story offers readers vague, scary information and points to a specific commercial product as a solution to a problem that readers may not know they had (if they have it at all). Some of the things mentioned in the story, like carbon monoxide poisoning, are legitimate concerns — but the story fails to mention options like carbon monoxide detectors, which would be less expensive options than the tech that the story does focus on. In short, consumers need sources of news that can offer reliable, thoughtful insight into health issues — not news stories that scare readers without offering context or detail."

Probiotics improve cognition in Alzheimer's patients,0,"This news release describes the results of a randomized controlled trial that examined the effects of milk supplemented with probiotic bacteria on cognitive function and metabolic status (the whole range of biochemical processes that occur within the body) in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease. Fifty-two men and women, aged 60-95 years, consumed either milk (the control group) or milk with a mixture of probiotics (the probiotic group) for 12 weeks. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and metabolic endpoints were measured through blood samples. The news release presented an accurate description of the study design, provided conservative explanations of the improvements seen in the intervention group, and emphasized the need for more research. However, it did not discuss several important aspects — namely, the cost and availability of the probiotic milk, potential harms of probiotic supplements in certain populations, and alternative therapies for treatment of Alzheimer’s symptoms. Interpretation of the results was also inaccurate, leaving this news release with quite a bit of room for improvement. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia, a general term used to describe various diseases and conditions that damage brain cells. Despite decades of research and improvements in quality of life for people living with this condition, ultimately Alzheimer’s is fatal and currently there is no cure. Therefore, potential dietary interventions to improve cognitive function are of interest. Drug development studies are underway to identify new treatments to stop, slow, or prevent Alzheimer’s, but because new drugs take years to produce — and because drugs that seem promising in early-stage studies may not work as hoped in large-scale trials — complementary and alternative therapies are an attractive option for Alzheimer’s patients. This study is the first clinical trial to evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation on cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, and researchers cautiously suggested that their findings may point toward a mechanism by which probiotics affect Alzheimer’s and possibly other neurological disorders. Although this study yielded promising results, the news release neglected to highlight the fact that the probiotic milk used as the study intervention is not available to the general population and did not provide any reference to assess the clinical relevance of the improvement in cognitive symptoms."
Anesthesia: A medical mainstay re-examined,2,"""This was a story about how some doctors are taking a new look at anesthesia, the consequences associated with its use, and possible options for minimizing anesthesia exposure. The story pointed out that anesthesia use is an important addition to medical care, but that there are certain possible risks that merit further evaluation. The story was somewhat alarmist, citing 'suggestions' that anestheisa might weaken the body's ability to kill tumor cells  thereby making cancer recurrence more likely or that it might trigger an inflammatory response leading to atherosclerosis and other serious conditions. Mostly animal studies are cited to raise alarm about anesthesia. There are relevant human studies and they should have cited those and the rates of adverse effects. Although one of the anesthesiologists interviewed for this story talked about 'increasing evidence', the story itself did not contain evidence or even traceable references to evidence on the topic. Instead, it quoted a number of experts about their 'suggestions', 'fears', and 'hopes' when it comes to the effects that anesthesia had on function. While the story did mention rats taking longer to run a maze as adults when subjected to prolonged anesthesia when young, there was no quantitative estimate for the size of the effect anesthesia had been demonstrated to play. Even when data were given (1998 Lancet study showing 10% of elderly surgery patients have worse scores on cognition tests post surgery) we get no information on the magnitude of the effect (is it clinically important?) or on the research design (and therefore, the likely validity of any findings). There were clear attempts to inject balance into the story. The story stated, """"Many clinical anesthesiologists question the relevance of the animal studies."""" One source said, """"Human babies are not large rat pups."""" It is also stated, """"Most anesthesiologists and surgeons, citing the millions of people the world over who live long, healthy lives after surgery, say there is no call for worry."""""""

Bitter taste receptors may hold the key to managing preterm labor,0,"This news release reports on a study examining substances that will stop preterm births by stopping uterine contractions. The researchers looked at strips of uterine tissue from both humans and mice, initiated contractions in the tissue using chemicals known to bring on labor, and then tested a bitter substance on the tissue. They write that this substance decreased contractions more effectively than current drugs used for this practice. They also briefly mentioned they tested the same drug in pregnant mice. The release neglects to share the name of the “bitter substance” (chloroquine) used to halt contractions in the human and mouse tissue, nor does it say how the experimental substance compared with any of the current treatments or name any of them. The release also would have served readers better by including a clear explanation that bitter taste receptors — usually only associated with the tongue — also exist in other cells in the body and that stopping early contractions is not always the best course of treatment. Preterm birth is one of the leading causes of infant mortality, according to the National Institutes of Health. The World Health Organization states “Common causes of preterm birth include multiple pregnancies, infections and chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure; however, often no cause is identified.” While not all babies born prematurely experience complications, being born too early can lead to short or long-term health problems. Stopping early labor may be one preventative way to reduce risks from preterm birth. A variety of drugs are currently used for stopping early contractions but have limited effectiveness and may carry risks."

Acupuncture Might Treat Certain Kind of Lazy Eye,1,"This story offered an informative but flawed summary of a study that tested acupuncture to treat a form of “lazy eye” known as anisometropic amblyopia. It was at its best when describing why the trial, despite its positive results, provides only preliminary evidence that acupuncture is an effective treatment for this condition. On the downside, it offered only a vague description of how the researchers assessed the treatment effects in this study, making the discussion of benefits much less meaningful than that provided in the competing coverage from WebMD. The story also failed to completely characterize the costs and availability of acupuncture, and didn’t explain that the research team might have a financial incentive to promote the effectiveness of acupuncture. Amblyopia — a condition which causes reduced vision in one eye because the eye and brain are not communicating properly — is a leading cause of vision impairment in children. Treatment is most successful when the condition is identified and addressed at an early age, but older children can also benefit from patching therapy which forces the weaker eye to work harder and communicate more effectively with the brain. Older children may resist wearing an eye patch, however, and it is possible that using a patch will lead to new problems in the better-functioning eye. This study suggests that acupuncture may be a safe and effective alternative to patching for older children with amblyopia. Now additional research will be needed to confirm whether the benefits of acupuncture are real and sustainable over the long term."

Study finds overuse of implanted defibrillators,2,"This story about a study on the overuse of implanted defibrillators packs in more information than many competing stories and hits nearly all of our marks, giving readers good context and a clear understanding of the study and its implications. We would have liked to have seen a bit more background information on the registry and on the guidelines. We are mystified by the lack of attention to the accompanying editorial in the journal that places the study into an important frame of reference and provides a good counter balance. The study in question examined data collected from a national registry on over 100,000 patients and concluded that 1/5 of the implants were outside existing guidelines. This number is troubling at face value but the story appears to be a bit more complicated. The accompanying editorial places the results in a slightly different perspective. Of the four criteria examined, only one (placement of the ICD in patients with severe heart failure) is an absolute. The other three criteria are related purely to timing and not to whether the device is of value. This nuance was not clarified in the story."

Marijuana May Help HIV Patients Keep Mental Stamina Longer,0,"Marijuana’s health benefits are widely touted but poorly understood. This release does little to add to the evidence. The health claim made in the headline has little to do with what was evaluated in the published study. There is no true quantification of the benefits of marijuana as a therapy for preserving cognitive function in AIDS patients, no context about the risks associated with smoking marijuana, no comparison to alternatives, no mention of costs, and not much in the way of explaining the strength of the study in question. This is especially problematic when it comes to marijuana. Like chocolate, marijuana is something that is often heralded for its health benefits, often with questionable findings underpinning the claims. As noted above, marijuana is widely used and many claims are indeed made about its benefits. It’s great that this study was undertaken if it adds to the body of knowledge. The objective of the study, however, was not to make clinical recommendations on marijuana benefits for HIV patients as suggested in the headline. According to the study, the objective was to measure the level of a biomarker indicating the presence of inflammation in HIV patients who used marijuana compared to those who did not. Researchers still need to better understand the plant’s biology and physiology to determine which populations will in fact benefit from its use, and to determine the best modes of delivery, dosing schedules, etc."

Cutting Sugar Rapidly Improves Heart Health Markers,1,"Reducing sugar—but not calories—in the diets of a small group of children who have obesity led to substantial reductions in heart disease risk factors in only nine days, a new study shows. This brief New York Times Well blog post does a good job explaining these details, including the cautionary information that the study was small and of short duration. But the cost of brevity is that it fails to offer readers the kinds of methodological and explanatory details that would have helped them judge the relatively cursory nature of the research. Instead, it encourages readers to view the study as part of a growing body of research by referring them to a longer and more detailed 2015 post about a study conducted by some of the same scientists. Alas, a quick look at the methodological details suggests that both studies stem from the same group of child participants. It is not unusual for a single study to generate several research articles. But one could make the argument here that holding such small studies in abeyance and waiting for the bigger picture would serve readers better. Including commentary from an independent expert also would have strengthened the post. Although we Americans cling desperately to our sugary foods, learning that reducing sugar could markedly improve our health might encourage significant behavior change in this country. There is a growing–but certainly not conclusive–body of evidence that suggests there might be unique concerns with sugar beyond just its calories, such as being a possible contributor to heart disease."

Novel Test Distinguishes Atypical Moles From Melanoma,1,"This news release from a large dermatology practice plugs a study asserting that imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) — a procedure that involves ionizing a tumor sample in order to identify its protein content — does a better job at determining whether a certain type of atypical mole is benign or a potentially fatal melanoma than the standard practice of examining the tissue under a microscope. The study, authored in part by the practice’s director of dermatopathology, was published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. The news release does not give data to quantify how well IMS diagnoses skin tumors or compares with an old-fashioned microscope. Nor does it discuss costs, availability, or study limitations. As a result, it’s difficult to assess how much this technology could help patients. A Spitz tumor is an uncommon skin lesion that usually occurs in children and young adults. It’s benign, but in some cases difficult to distinguish from a malignant melanoma. Moles that are impossible to classify are called “atypical Spitzoid neoplasms,” or ASMs. They often turn out to be benign but present a dilemma for patients and physicians because it’s unclear whether they should be treated. Developing an accurate test for these tumors would reduce anxiety and unnecessary treatments. Better diagnosis methods in order to “prevent aggressive surgical treatment in children and young adults” is an aim of the Yale School of Medicine’s Spitzoid Neoplasm Repository, which was a key player in the study. That’s a laudable goal that IMS might help to achieve."

Remedies: Honey for Coughing,1,"The story attempts to synthsize the available evidence on the value of honey as a treatment for cough in children. In doing so, it provides what is arguably incomplete and potentially misleading information to the consumer. The results of the 2007 paper, highlighted in the blog, should have been explained a bit more completely. Indeed honey did fair better than the active ingredient in most cough syrups, dextromethorphan. But statistically significant results don’t necessarily translate to the results parents can expect at 3 AM; that is, are the effects not only detectable by researchers, but substantial enough to make a difference that parents and small patients would really notice. Helping young children cope with a cold can be a frustrating experience for parents. Parents want a simple remedy, but that remedy has eluded them throughout the years. As this story points out, the best medicine may be no medicine at all. To prove that point, though, reporters need to provide readers with the hard evidence. In reality there are no proven and acceptable treatments for cough in children. That’s why this blog, brief as it is, is important and should have provided readers with better information."

One could ask, “What’s the harm in a story about potential benefits from strawberries?” The potential harm is the loss of journalistic and scientific credibility. The study didn’t prove what the headline trumpets. There are serious limitations to this kind of research, conducted in only 36 people.

GPS-like system helps surgeons align joints,2,"Too often when a reporter learns about a developing medical technology used locally, the result is a gee-whiz rave. This well-reported, judiciously written story on navigation-assisted joint surgery is a welcome exception. The story plainly says the surgical technique has not been proven effective. The reporter interviewed four physicians about its value, including one who has not used the machine. The story discusses the potential benefits and harms without falsely emphasizing either one. The reader takeaway is that there is an interesting but uNPRoven new technology available for local joint replacement surgery. Some may want to talk to their doctors about it, but none will go expecting a miracle treatment certain to improve outcomes.

"HPV test more sensitive than Pap, questions remain",2,"Questions remain – even though a large review was done to try to decide if women should get more than the typical cervical cancer screening, known as a Pap test. This story does justice to the sometimes volatile topic of screening for cancer by laying out carefully what reviewers found when they looked at four different clinical studies comparing different tests for cervical cancer. While the newer techniques may have some advantages in some cases, they are not clearly better at diagnosing cancer early or proven to save lives, according to the reviewers. The story carefully explains the tricky landscape of test sensitivity and why it can lead to the risk of many falsely positive results. It could have done a better job of making clear the options: conventional Pap, liquid-Pap, and liquid-based Pap test plus HPV test (“cotesting”) – and HPV test alone. The way Pap tests are done has changed a great deal over the past decade, with the advent of new “liquid-based” testing technology that allows concurrent tests for human papillomavirus (HPV). Some strains of HPV promote cervical cancer. Although the HPV test is more sensitive than the traditional Pap smear, its proper role in cervical cancer screening has not been clear. Because screening for cervical cancer is a cornerstone of preventive care for women, it is important to understand how to use these new technologies in ways that provide greatest benefit, while also being mindful of the costs."

In some ways, the story is thorough, addressing potential side effects and conflicts of interest very well. The story discusses the potential benefits in depth, which is good, but fails to quantify those benefits — which is problematic. The story also does a good job of placing the work in context, highlighting the increasing profile of research into the use of hallucinogens as therapeutic tools for mental health problems. However, the story would have been even stronger if it had discussed the existing literature on the use of psilocybin to address anxiety in cancer patients. We also reviewed two news releases related to the research:   Depression and other mental health struggles are common and significant among people with cancer, especially terminal cancer.

That moderate alcohol consumption reduces heart disease risk is not a new idea, however recommending it in individuals with high blood pressure is controversial given that excessive alcohol can actually raise blood pressure. This study supports the idea that moderate amounts of alcohol can be just as beneficial to men with hypertenstion as it is for those who do not have high blood pressure.

Radiosurgery reduces depression and improves quality of life for patients with facial pain,0,"In this release from medical journal publisher Elsevier, researchers at the Cleveland Clinic recommend using sterotactic radiosurgery as a first-line treatment for trigeminal neuralgia (TN), a very painful nerve disorder of the face. The study involved 50 people and used patient submitted questionnaires to evaluate the success of the treatment. The release doesn’t offer any numbers to put the effectiveness in context; we’re only told that volunteers “reported an improved quality of life and lower rates of depression after radiosurgery.” The release also omits costs and harms and is unclear about the availability of the surgery. While the intervention is said to be effective, more details are needed before readers accept the news release’s claim that “Doctors should consider radiosurgery for patients with trigeminal neuralgia.”   Trigeminal neuralgia is a nerve pain syndrome with an unknown cause. It’s symptoms can vary from mildly intense to quite severe pain. For some, symptoms resolve on their own over time and for others, symptoms can persist. There are a number of medications that are used for treating trigeminal neuralgia. These medicines can help but may have side effects. The treatment described in this piece, radiosurgery, involves radiation treatment and may be considered a second-line treatment after medicines have failed to help or have caused intolerable side effects. Though the study does not compare radiosurgery to alternative treatments, outcomes show that symptoms decrease after treatment. Since the study did not compare stereotactic radiation with other types of treatment, it is hard to say that this study supports a role for using this treatment earlier in the course of a patient’s symptoms."

The news release deserves credit for pointing out researchers’ financial conflicts. It also states that there have been no clinical trials to determine whether NR produces any actual health benefits. But that caveat comes after a misleading headline and first paragraph that assert the substance increases levels of a cell metabolite “linked to multiple health benefits” without mentioning these benefits have only been shown to occur in mice. Also, it doesn’t seem fair to characterize this as “new research” as the news release states, since the manufacturer announced these safety findings last year. [Editor’s note: This review originally noted under the Funding Sources and Conflict of Interest criterion that the release didn’t note funders. That was incorrect and we have revised the commentary in that section.] NR is being is aggressively marketed under the name Niagen for a variety of health issues including weight loss and age-related conditions, despite a dearth of evidence that it benefits human health. Its manufacturer, ChromaDex, recently announced a deal to expand sales in major retail chains and make it available in consumables such as protein shakes and nutrition bars. It’s also sponsoring research on whether NR can treat two rare disorders, Cockayne syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia, which would open a door to the prescription market. HealthNewsReview.org’s review of a Boston Globe story last year pointed out the need for news stories to cut through the hype over this unproven product. Similarly, a news release that wrongly suggests NR offers health benefits — even if it contains caveats further down — could lead more people to buy it."

It appears the study merely hypothesized that the benefits of fasting may be associated with breast cancer reduction, but this hypothesis was not directly tested by the researchers. The release provides no evidence that the researchers looked at actual breast cancer risk in the subjects. We’re only told about “fasting associated with a 4 percent lower postprandial glucose level” – a surrogate, perhaps, but not the risk described in the headline.

So if there was a simple, non-invasive method of gauging a person’s risk for developing a heart attack later on, simply by scanning a person’s eyes, that would be a substantive aid in public health. Sadly this story fails to back up that dream with any real substance, and by doing so, harms readers by leading them on. Better to have not offered the story at all."
Milk-Bone dog treats cause cancer in one of every two dogs that eat them.,0,"We were unable to substantiate claims that BHA, which is commonly used as a preservative in Milk-Bones (and many other dog treats), posed a risk to pets. Decades of research indicated that BHA was generally regarded as safe in both human and animal food products, and the only information cited by sites claiming otherwise was speculative and published in 1991. While data was insufficient to prove a link between BHA (a preservative) and cancer in dogs, it was worth bearing in mind that a lack of preservatives often posed a far greater immediate health risk due to potential growth of mold and bacteria."

Coffee could literally be a lifesaver,1,"This CNN story describes yet another observational study of the possible links between coffee consumption and health, this one concluding that overall, whether decaf or regular, coffee drinking is linked to reduced risk of death from heart disease, diabetes, and neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s Disease, although not cancer. The headline — “Coffee could literally be a lifesaver” — is overblown given the types of evidence we’re talking about. But the story otherwise does a worthy and responsible job of framing the study’s weaknesses and strengths, particularly so in explaining confounding factors and why so many coffee studies historically have yielded “murky” results. It also takes a pretty good stab at exploring the study’s suggestion that natural chemicals in the coffee may be responsible for the beverage’s potential health benefits, an effort that was essentially missing from a story in STAT that was otherwise much stronger in describing the strengths and weaknesses of this and all observational studies. The CNN story also aptly noted the novel analysis of coffee drinking in a non-smoking subset of the nearly 200,000 subjects. Overall, this CNN piece could have been made stronger by having outside experts comment on the findings, as the STAT piece did to excellent effect; by offering more qualitative details about the sources of the data; by noting that in excessive quantities, the new study identified a slight increase in risk of death; and — as the STAT piece did superbly, noting the likely “benefits” in terms of absolute risk (very, very small). Readers and viewers of mass media have been nearly whiplashed by claims and counterclaims related to the benefits and risks of coffee drinking. A few studies over the past several decades have concluded that, at least in large amounts, coffee can be “toxic,” but most of the coverage has focused on the drink’s possible health benefits, but in ways that led to substantial confusion. The new analysis, described in the American Heart Association journal Circulation, has some significant statistical assets not present in previous studies, including a subset analysis of non-smokers’ death risks. Its central finding — that coffee safely confers health benefits (essentially reduced death risks for some major categories of disease) even in relatively high doses among non-smokers — is likely to be reassuring to coffee addicts — and their physicians."
St. Francis heart surgeon pioneering ‘new horizon’ repair technique,0,"This story performed cheerleading for local research in a number of ways. It said the procedure:   May revolutionize cardiac care;   Could save and improve thousands of lives (no source cited for this projection);    Has vast potential. But – for the new use described in the story – it’s only been tested in animals. No discussion of evidence, of costs, of harms. Only anecdotes. Incomplete discussion of alternative options for the problem in question. A reality check on a story like this:  If the research came out of Ann Arbor or Columbus instead of Indianapolis, do you really think it would get this kind of play? Would it have been covered at all? If not, why not? And then why is it worthy of such hyperlocal hyperbole just because it did involve an Indianapolis physician?"
Deep Brain Stimulation Might Ease Tough-to-Treat Hypertension,1,"This story describes the experience of an individual who had a deep brain stimulation (DBS) device surgically implanted for the treatment of pain following a stroke, and subsequently found that the device had a beneficial effect on his high blood pressure. It’s an interesting finding — no doubt about it — but results from a single person don’t amount to much from a scientific standpoint, and they don’t mean much to other patients. And so we question why this report would be considered newsworthy for anyone outside of this field of research. To its credit, this story did spend some time drawing attention the limitations of this evidence. However, the story failed to provide information on costs and harms that would have provided a counterweight to enthusiastic talk of benefits. The story also didn’t identify financial relationships between the case report authors and manufacturers of DBS devices–information that readers deserve to have as they ponder the merits of these very preliminary findings. If a friend tells you that he was able to sleep better at night because he ate six raw eggs before going to bed, you might:  A. Be doubtful, or B. Try it yourself. You probably would not turn around telling someone that “eating six raw eggs might ease your insomnia.” Yet this is what stories about case studies do, especially ones that present the findings in as optimistic a tone as this one does."

FDA approves new flu pill that can be taken after onset of symptoms,0,"This story is one of two we are reviewing that focuses on FDA’s approval of a drug designed to speed patient recovery from flu symptoms (the second story is from The New York Times). The drug is baloxavir marboxil, marketed under the trade name Xofluza. This ABC News story didn’t adequately address cost, potential harms, or the fact that Xofluza worked no better than oseltamivir (sold as Tamiflu) at reducing flu symptoms in a clinical trial. It also told readers that researchers think the drug “will reduce spread of the flu,” but didn’t point out that there is no evidence to show that as a possible benefit. Influenza is fairly common, as recent findings from the CDC make clear. That means that many people will likely have to make decisions about how to deal with the flu and flu symptoms in the coming year. Making an informed decision requires patients to have good information on costs and potential health risks associated with their treatment options — and that’s particularly true when new treatment options come onto the market. This story doesn’t adequately address those key issues."
One extra year of schooling for girls reduces infant mortality rates among their children by up to 10 percent.,1,"The head of the World Food Programme said that one extra year of schooling for girls reduces the infant mortality rates among their children by up to 10 percent. Broadly speaking, the association between more education of young women and better odds for their offspring is real. But this claim suffers from several flaws. It speaks of infant mortality when the underlying research addressed child mortality. It asserts a causal link when the data, while very suggestive, don’t fully prove the point. And it treated every year of schooling the same. Perhaps most important, UNESCO, the source that the World Food Programme relied on, has distanced itself from this statistic.

"Mammogram Rate Declining, Study Suggests",0,"""The story focuses on the documented decrease in use of mammography, which is portrayed here as a negative. The anchor and her guest, a breast cancer surgeon, speculate why fewer women have been getting mammograms; they attribute this trend, in part, to legal issues closing mammography centers. They also speculate that if women aren’t getting their HRT prescriptions, they aren’t getting their mammogram, for which there is little evidence. The decrease is described as """"shocking"""" and """"frightening"""" (and by implication, those who are not screened are at risk of dying), and there is no acknowledgement that not being screened may be a reasoned response by informed consumers. By using such terms, the broadcast is fear-mongering. It is not """"shocking"""" that some women, especially lower-risk women age 40-49, would forego an annual mammography in light of recent evidence that the value of mammography is questionable in this group, and for women who have other medical conditions that might shorten their lives. The story begins with the statement, """"Women over the age of 40 are supposed to have one every year."""" But a major medical group, the American College of Physicians (ACP), published new clinical guidelines on mammography in the 40s just a month before this story, and those guidelines do not agree with the story’s opening statement. The ACP guidelines were never mentioned in the story. Although most agree mammography saves lives among women aged 50 to 69, mammography also has the potential to cause these women harm. Mammograms increase the diagnosis of lesions. Left untreated, some of these will become cancers, but many will not. The discovery of lesions leads not only to fear and anxiety, but also to invasive diagnostic tests and invasive treatments (including mastectomy or lumpectomy). Finally, mammography exposes women to radiation that could itself cause breast cancer 10 or 20 years down the road. (Br J Cancer 2005;93:590-6. Lancet 2000;355:1757-70). Because medicine does not yet have perfect estimates of the harms of mammography, journalists should explain the potential benefits and harms, and thus help women to evaluate their own individual preferences so that they can choose the course of action that best suits them. A secondary focus of the story is the """"feel good"""" elements of planning a mammogram around a day of shopping or a spa date. “Pampering yourself” might help some women overcome the fear of scheduling a mammogram, but this does not factor into their decision about whether or not to be screened for breast cancer, and broadcast news organizations do a disservice to their female viewers by placing health screenings in this context."""

In fact, there are enough ways for a minority to gum up the works that aren’t counted in the statistics that the actual number of blockages -- if it could be divined -- could well push the number higher than 400. And that’s a key problem for Grimes -- the number can’t be divined, meaning that Grimes’ figure, even if it is actually a low estimate, communicates a false sense of statistical specificity.

The evidence is reported adequately, and the sourcing is sufficient. The study itself is most important, however, because it appears to verify the important role of B-cells in the development of MS. Since most current MS drugs target T-cells, the implications of these findings for development of new treatments are significant. By focusing on the clinical results of a small trial rather than the important discovery about the role of B cells, the article may invite people with relapsing-remitting MS to wonder whether they could, or should, try to use this drug, which is on the market and approved for other uses, off-label.

Cognitive behavior therapy can help overcome fear of the dentist,1,"The release focuses on a paper published in the British Dental Journal  that evaluated the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on patients with dental phobia or related fears concerning dentistry. The release reports that CBT allowed many patients with dental phobia to receive dental care without relying on sedation, and that CBT and sedation complement each other as ways of helping patients with dental phobia address their dental health needs. The release did a good job describing benefits but was very vague on what researchers meant by the term “sedation” and the types of procedures most feared by those with phobias. In addition, the release didn’t delve into any of the limitations of this study, which was essentially a case series — considered a very low level of evidence. A lot of research has been done on dental anxiety — and it’s very common. Most such studies find that at least 10 percent (and as many as 20 percent) of people have dental anxiety or dental phobia. These fears make people less likely to see a dentist, and put them at greater risk of oral health problems — which can, in turn, have significant impacts on an individual’s quality of life. (Anyone who has ever had a toothache will agree with us.) In short, identifying ways to help people deal with dental anxiety and phobias has the potential to improve the quality of life for a great many people. In addition, there have been many studies (reported in a meta-analysis and systematic review) that have demonstrated the usefulness of CBT in preventing the need for sedation in these patients. As sedation carries certain risks and does not address any underlying issues leading to dental phobia, CBT could be a positive alternative for many patients."
"Have a baby at new low, low price, says fertility doctor Joel Batzofin",0,"Is cheap really the whole story? This piece focuses on a novel infertility or subfertility treatment that is still an active subject of active research in the biomedical research community. It provides little data and little balanced expert comment. Also, there is NO evidence that anyone has data that directly compares IVF and IVM, let alone understands cost per cycle, conception, or healthy pregnancy. The story does note that IVM (in vitro maturation) treatments are not widely available and this method is not as successful or widely accepted in the medical community as IVF (in vitro fertilization) treatments, and that Dr. Batzofin is one of the first doctors in Manhattan to offer the treatments while simultaneously conducting a clinical trial on IVM. Dr. Batzofin discusses his own “number needed to treat” in order to consider IVM a success (20 to one pregnancy), however, this seems arbitrary. There is no sense of valid expected outcomes from data. Doing this story when even the outcomes of the first three transfers is unknown is showmanship not reporting. The story makes a simple comparison of IVF v. IVM for the lay reader, but does not discuss risks for women with and without polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOs). Other methods to increase fertility are not discussed. The story does compare average costs of one course of IVF treatments with one course of IVM treatments. But given the lack of proven success with IVM, multiple rounds of treatments may be necessary to conceive. This is not specifically stated and the focus of the story, a promotion of IVM (and Dr. Batzofin’s clinic) as a more cost-effective method of fertility treatments is misplaced. The story mentions that IVM has been studied in some clinical trials in Denmark and Canada; results have been mixed and mostly included younger women, who would have an easier time conceiving. We are not told if these are randomized clinical trials. There are no data presented from these trials. Lastly, the story does not do a good job finding unbiased sources to speak to the difference between IVF and IVM treatments–only one person is cited. An additional researcher or fertility expert could provide a balanced review of the current evidence (both benefits and harms of IVM for PCO and non-PCO women) and discuss less dramatic first-line  treatments to enhance fertility. The story does interview women who serve mainly to promote Dr. Batzofin’s clinic."
Heart Scan Can Fine-Tune Risk Estimate for Patients Considering Statins,2,"Credit NHLBI. This story hits almost all the high points we look for in a news report. It gives readers not only the basic summary of an analysis of how CT scan results showing levels of calcium deposits in coronary arteries are associated with 10-year rates of heart attacks and other cardiovascular disease, but it includes more than one skeptical voice and plainly discusses study limitations and potential harms. Still, our criteria are demanding, and the story falls a bit short on two points: disclosures of researcher relationships with industry and then alternatives available to people who might consider getting one of these scans. But the strengths of this story are an example of how to get it right. Too often, stories about medical tests fall into the “why not” category. This story lays out the potential benefits reported by researchers, but it also provides readers clear and useful explanations of the nuances and potential pitfalls of this sort of CT scan. The story is important because the number of people placed on statins has progressively increased over the years — and if some people can avoid these drugs without putting themselves at increased risk, then it’s probably good that they avail themselves of the opportunity."

What's false: In explaining their reasons for voting against the bill, senators did not express indifference to the fate of newborn babies, but rather argued that the bill was legally unnecessary (existing federal law and some states' laws already protect babies born alive after abortions), unfairly criminalized health care practitioners, and inappropriately interfered in the doctor-patient relationships."

Lymph Node Study Shakes Pillar of Breast Cancer Care,2,"We do wish that the story had provided a few more hard numbers, especially in regard to cost. And the story could have made it clear higher up that this study does not mean that lymph nodes should never be removed. But, overall, this story earns a top five-star score. The story says it all: “The discovery turns standard medical practice on its head. Surgeons have been removing lymph nodes from under the arms of breast cancer patients for 100 years, believing it would prolong women’s lives by keeping the cancer from spreading or coming back.” Patients who receive a cancer diagnosis are often thinking about one thing; metastisis. It has been drilled into our brains that cancer spreads and often can spread quickly. This study shows that, because doctors already are providing patients with chemotherapy and radiation, those treatments may wipe out the cancer in the lymph nodes and negate the need for surgery. This will be tough for some patients, and doctors, to accept, though. As the story notes, “Doctors and patients alike find it easy to accept more cancer treatment on the basis of a study, Dr. Morrow said, but get scared when the data favor less treatment.”"
"Curcumin Improves Memory and Mood, New UCLA Study Says",0,"This news release summarizes an 18-month study of 40 healthy adults to determine whether oral curcumin — the active substance in the spice turmeric — has cognitive benefits. While it does provide some details on the study design and results, it is incomplete in several important areas. For example, is a 28% improvement in cognitive test results clinically important or simply statistically significant? This should have been explained. The release did not speak to the costs of the supplement used although it appears to be commercially available. Furthermore, there are harms and conflicts of interest that should have been explored further. Curcumin has been investigated as a potential therapy for a wide range of conditions. Because ingested curcumin is poorly absorbed and rapidly metabolized, its bioavailability has been brought into question. This study, according to the published article, used a more bioavailable form of curcumin called Theracurmin. Curcumin has shown some promising anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects but most of these studies have been in mice. Given the wide range of health claims being made regarding curcumin, we believe that news releases and stories about this substance need to be cautious and pay close attention to study design and limitations."

"Many women could benefit from earlier mammograms, analysis finds",0,"This story summarizes an as-yet-unpublished research study that performed risk assessments for breast cancer among women age 40 to 44 visiting a specialty breast clinic. Of the 900 women whose risks were assessed, about 50 percent had an above-average risk for breast cancer, the analysis found. The study did not examine if these women went on to develop breast cancer, only whether they had risk factors that challenged the common notion to wait until 45 for screening, something that should have been better emphasized in the story. The story didn’t discuss the limitations of risk assessments, nor explain or define what “risk” really means. The headline also overstated the scope of the study. These issues–paired with a lack of information on costs and screening harms–add up to an incomplete story. Understanding a person’s risk for cancer is beneficial and can help doctors and patients make informed decisions about screenings and care. But given the conflicting information about screening mammography over the past few years, news coverage must take pains not to add to the confusion."

Folic acid might be losing its sheen,2,"This story does a good job alerting readers to scientific debate about the benefits and harms of fortifying food with folic acid. It is a welcome contrast to stories that either adore or vilify vitamins. The writer neatly lays out the historical points about supplementation of the grain supply in 1998, the benefits with regard to neural tube defect, and the newer concerns about colorectal and prostate cancer. This is a nuanced discussion, and the reader comes away with a pretty good feeling for the problem at hand. However, the story highlights the views of a single nutrition researcher in a way that blurs the distinction between his personal beliefs and the published evidence of potential links between folic acid fortification and certain cancers. The story also fails to address apparent discrepancies between the cancer statistics quoted by the researcher (which seem to indicate colorectal cancer rates rose around the time folic acid fortification was introduced) and those published by the CDC (which highlight a decline in colorectal incidence over the years since fortification began.)"

Using Vegetable Oils to Lower Cholesterol May Not Improve Longevity,2,"This story is about new evidence that may diminish the importance of limiting animal fats in people’s diets to reduce risk of deaths from heart disease. A new group of researchers re-examined a 45-year-old randomized controlled study of 9,000 people who were put in two groups: one group replaced animal fats with corn oil in their diet, the other ate animal fats. The risk of death from heart attack was higher in the vegetable-oil group, even though certain markers of cholesterol in their blood did become lower. The story does a good job of explaining the study’s design, and some of the complex issues surrounding dietary habits and heart disease. But this story falls short by not quantifying study elements: no numbers for cholesterol level changes, no numbers for changes in risk. Diet appears to play a role in dozens of chronic diseases, including heart disease. Research that helps tease out which fats are truly better for people helps us further understand the issue, though it is complex and evolving. News coverage should not only be accurate, it should help readers understand how the latest study fits into the greater body of scientific knowledge."

A Ray of Hope for Patients With Malignant Brain Tumors,0,"An image from the Cleveland Clinic website promoting the NeuroBlate deviceAs the musical King of Siam might have said, this article is a “puzzlement.” Written more in the style of an opinion piece, and by a neurosurgeon at the Cleveland Clinic whose website states that it was the “first” to test the technology promoted in the text, the story describes a computer-assisted brain tumor ablation platform that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administrative five years ago and was designed to offer life-extending options for those with difficult-to-treat or inoperable malignant brain cancers. The article does a pretty good job of setting out the limited and sometimes terrible therapeutic options such patients face, but the tone overall is promotional and there is no discussion of the costs or harms associated with the device. There is also no “news” context for the article, or answer to the question, “why is this information news now?” No recent clinical trial data are cited, and it appears that the last published clinical trial was in 2013, a phase I study of 10 patients, which saw modest life extension for some patients, along with serious side effects in most, including brain swelling. Without citing specific supportive data, the article states that “hundreds of patients” have undergone successful treatment with the NeuroBlate System. (Interestingly, there is an ongoing retrospective registry sponsored by the company to determine outcomes with no results as yet.) Overall, the information in the piece is accurate with respect to the challenges neurosurgeons and their patients face, but it’s a mystery why U.S. News & World Report (USN&WR) chose to “cover” the topic at this point in time; why a neurosurgeon was chosen to present it as a piece of journalism; and why no other sources were cited that might have updated the information and made it newsworthy. As the article itself notes, primary malignant brain tumors — and  brain tumors that occur because cancer in other organs have spread there — pose serious therapeutic challenges because healthy brain tissue can be damaged along with cancer during radiation, surgical or chemical treatments. In recent years, numerous computer-assisted, navigational, and tissue-sparing technologies have extended and refined the use of lasers and robotic probes. With them, neurosurgeons can prevent or minimize damage to healthy brain tissue by precisely guiding therapies that burn, cut, or kill off malignant tissue. The article explains the need for such technologies, but then mystifyingly focuses on just one such assistive platform called NeuroBlate, a self-described “minimally invasive robotic laser thermotherapy.” Collectively, such technologies do arguably offer a “ray of hope” as the title says, but readers would have been better served by a wider discussion of these technologies and their status and accessibility. And it might have been helpful to note what others, including a European technology assessment agency, had to say about the approach used by Neuroblate, which is called magnetic resonance thermometry (MRT)-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT): “At present, the effectiveness of MRT-guided LITT is unknown. Consequently, the small body of evidence cannot be used to make an informed decision regarding the use of MRT-guided LITT. Therefore, it is recommended that MRT-guided LITT be monitored for 24 months, at which time the results of three larger case series will be available.”"
"A Vaginal Ring Could Prevent HIV, Two Huge Studies Just Found",1,"Vaginal ring. Credit: International Partnership for Microbicides This article discusses two studies surrounding a new device for preventing HIV infection. The device is a vaginal ring that dispenses an antiviral compound called dapivirine which can prevent the spread of HIV in women, according to scientists presenting their research at a medical conference. The device must be worn daily and replaced monthly in order to be effective. One of the studies described was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the other was an unpublished abstract. The ring contains an antiviral agent that works against the virus, but experts caution this method only seems to curb about 27 percent of transmissions from one sexual partner to the other. This story does a good job of providing context, although we would have liked a more cautious headline (and less use of the word “huge,” in general, in the text) and a better definition of pre-exposure prophylaxis since previous efforts have mainly focused on treating those who already contracted the virus. We applaud the careful way the story gave details of the two research studies, including their size and length and where they were conducted. Because sub-Saharan Africa is hardest hit by HIV, and has few health resources, we wish the story had included discussion of how much the ring will cost. Women and men worldwide are at risk of catching the HIV virus from sexual partners. While there are precautions that might limit the spread, they are often not under the control of women. This vaginal ring, with a compound that interferes with the virus, could be worn discreetly by women to protect themselves. While the 27 percent effectiveness may seem modest, these two studies being reported raise a new hope for putting control of limiting the spread of the virus into more women’s hands."

The Case Against – and for – Arthroscopic Knee Surgery,2,"This news story uses a recent meta-analysis of already-published research as the news hook to review the pros and cons of arthroscopic knee surgery to treat both acute and chronic knee pain. The article overall leaves thoughtful readers with a “think twice or thrice” take home message if they are considering arthroscopy, or told by a physician to have it. The story could have done a better job discussing the evidence for and against this common surgery. It also mostly misses emphasizing a key point in the published research that for the vast majority of patients who undergo arthroscopy when they have both degenerative disease and tears in the knee’s cushioning tissue, exercise works just as well. Given the rare but potentially serious risks of arthroscopy (infection and blood clots, for example, as noted in the article) and the lengthy recovery and rehab (around six weeks of limitation and therapy), stories like this one are important to help the public understand the serious limitations of arthroscopy, and to avoid the lure of a promised but unlikely quick surgical “fix” for pain. That lure is substantial, given that what often works better over time is serious weight loss, exercise and other lifestyle changes that most people find difficult at best."

Prenatal Blood Tests Could Detect Cancer in Mothers,2,"This Wall Street Journal story offers a thoughtful and thorough summary of a presentation (and related study in JAMA) about the ability of commercial prenatal blood tests to also uncover hidden cancers in pregnant women. The story makes clear that the study’s finding of “rare cases” of cancer “underscores both challenges and opportunities” for the tests, particularly those related to the tests’ potential to reveal elevated risks for future diseases. Other stories, including one from CBS News, focused more viscerally on the handful of mothers whose hidden cancers were detected by the fetal blood work. While stories focusing on such vignettes may pack a significant emotional punch, they also may leave readers with an exaggerated sense of these tests’ cancer-finding ability and the risk that most women face. As demonstrated by the WSJ coverage, there are many ethical and social issues raised by widespread DNA testing that also merit discussion. There is increasing demand by physicians and pregnant women to perform noninvasive prenatal blood tests as a safer means of establishing fetal risk for Down Syndrome and other serious genetic abnormalities. Although professional guidelines suggest that only women at high risk of carrying fetuses with serious genetic abnormalities get these tests, they are already widely used because other procedures, such as amniocentesis, can occasionally lead to miscarriage. The discovery that in a few rare cases, the abnormalities detected in the tests have nothing to do with the fetus, but with a mother’s undiagnosed cancer instead, will likely lead to even more demand for use of these tests. That poses not only the ethical problem of whether and when to divulge incidental genetic risks also uncovered in maternal DNA (say, of breast cancer), but also a potential explosion of costs related to use of the blood tests to screen every pregnant woman to find a very small number of cancers."

Longtime antidepressant could slow Parkinson's,0,"Researchers at the University of Michigan observed by looking at medical records a correlation between patients taking anti-depressants known as tricyclics and what appeared to be a delay in the worsening of Parkinson’s disease symptoms.

They did not do experiments on people. The release does not give us any metric for the “slowing” that they observed. We wish there had been some numbers putting the results in context to help us judge the importance of such a small early study, or perhaps that the University had waited to issue a release until more was known. [Editor’s note: The summary was revised to refer to alpha-synuclein protein, not amyloid plaque.] This “early concept” study does not prove that the anti-depressant known as nortriptyline will “slow” Parkinson’s disease in people. We fear the headline and lead sentence of the news release will mislead most readers into thinking there is proof where there is none. About 50,000 people are diagnosed each year in the United States, according to the National Institutes of Health and the economic and emotional burden of this degenerative disease is massive.

World-first ketamine trial shows promise for geriatric depression,0,"This news release does a marginal job of describing what appears to be the first randomized, placebo controlled trial of the anesthetic agent ketamine for hard-to-treat depression in older adults. It offers a baffling, apparently incorrect account of the study findings and skimps on explaining what the alternatives are for treating depression in older adults. It could also have been greatly strengthened by noting the limitations of the study. Only 16 volunteers were enrolled and the study had only a 5-week controlled treatment period with a 6-month uncontrolled follow-up. The release earns praise for its explanation of the complex protocol of the research, the limitations of previous studies in determining the value of ketamine and noting that there is still much to learn about the drug and its long-term effects and risks. In the end, though, this release doesn’t leave us any more clued in about how ready for prime time clinical use ketamine is — or is not. And its headline is a good reminder of why “promising” is one of the 7 words you shouldn’t use in medical news. Ketamine is an old, relatively inexpensive, fast acting anesthetic drug when used in common doses, inducing a trance-like state, sedation, and temporary “amnesia.” It’s in the same class of drugs as nitrous oxide and propofol, the latter often used at the start of surgical anesthesia. If a safe, effective way can be developed to extend the drug’s use to help treatment-resistant older people with serious depression, that would be a significant advance in improving the quality of life for millions."

Medical societies were warning that BPA’s similarity to estrogens could disrupt the human hormone system and pose health risks, especially to fetuses and newborns."
"Lilly’s Alzheimer’s Drug May Slow Patients’ Decline, Study Shows Separate study shows experimental Biogen drug also holds promise",1,"The story looks at the status of two drugs that are being evaluated as treatments for delaying the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. One drug, solanezumab, has been in the news off and on for years. Early trials failed to show positive benefits for the drug, but now the manufacturer is poised to release findings that it says will show a benefit for patients with so-called “mild” Alzheimer’s. The second drug, aducanumab, was recently the subject of a small, early-stage clinical trial. Its manufacturer is poised to announce that the drug appears to slow cognitive decline. Both drugs are designed to lower levels of amyloid in the brain, which is thought by many scientists to play a causal role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease. However, as the story itself notes, neither of the new findings tell us whether these drugs will actually work. A more definitive, large-scale study of solanezumab is not expected to report findings until late 2016 (at the earliest). And the wait for definitive results on aducanumab will be even longer. Drug development is a big business; new drugs for treating Alzheimer’s disease would generate billions of dollars in revenue for pharmaceutical manufacturers. Here we see that these companies are promoting interim findings that, one suspects, they hope will positively affect their stock price. And this story will likely help them accomplish that goal. But it may also stir up false hopes in Alzheimer’s patients and their loved ones, when it’s clear that neither of these drugs has yet demonstrated any clinically meaningful benefit — and that neither will be available to consumers for years, if ever. We recognize that these results have business implications and that this story is targeted at a business and investing crowd, Nevertheless, the piece will inevitably be read by many general readers conducting searches on the Internet — which is how we found it. And for those readers, we think it’s vitally important for stories like this to include a clear explanation of potential benefits and harms as well as a discussion of the evidence on offer. We suspect that business readers would also profit from that information."

NIH study confirms benefits of intensive blood pressure management among seniors aged 75 and older,0,"This news release reports on new results from an on-going and major clinical trial — the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) — that compared the outcomes of two groups of elderly hypertensive people given different systolic blood pressure goals — 140 mm of mercury versus 120 mm of mercury. And while it does report that the clinical outcome for those in the lower target group was better than that of the higher target group, the release (from the National Institutes of Health [NIH] section dealing with heart and lung disease) gives scant details that might help readers apply the results to their own situations. The omissions mirror problems we’ve seen in previous NIH press communications about the SPRINT study, which we’ve called attention to repeatedly on our blog: NIH, news media, need to slow down on the SPRINT hype NIH SPRINT study sparks questions about overtreatment of mild hypertension Do published SPRINT study results live up to premature NIH news release hype? Informed patients need one thing not provided in SPRINT trial news: what were the absolute benefit/harm numbers? The public has gotten conflicting recommendations on what the optimum goal for blood pressure treatment should be for seniors. The recommendations range from 140 mm Hg for adults to 150 mm Hg for adults aged 60 and up, and to 160 mm Hg for people over 80. The release states that, “About three-fourths of the U.S. population aged 75 and older live with hypertension, a leading contributor to cardiovascular disease and death,” which certainly argues for the importance of any strategy that can mitigate this condition. If changing either a medication or its dosage can bring about a better clinical outcome, then surely that is important."

"Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence.",2,"""California Congresswoman Jackie Speier recently claimed: """"Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence."""" Speier’s claim is backed up by the CDC’s fatal injury report data, which shows an average of 7.15 young people per day, aged 0 to 19, died in connection with firearms between 2013 and 2015. It’s important to note these include all types of gun deaths: accidents, homicides and suicides. All gun deaths are violent, but Speier’s statement could be interpreted as only including homicides or accidents. Finally, Speier’s claim might also lead some to think she’s talking about young school aged children, given that she invokes an elementary school shooting. The data show teenagers and young adults make up the vast majority of deaths due to guns in America, while elementary aged children account for a small fraction. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the source Speier relied on, offers a more complete look at this statistic on its website. It notes that children """"and teens"""" are included in the seven deaths per day. Speier’s statement is on the right track. But it could have used some clarifications."""

Blood Test Might Detect Deadly Pancreatic Cancer in Early Stages,0,"This story is about a study of a new test for pancreatic cancer. It covered a lot of ground in a short space. It included many voices and a lot of good background about pancreatic cancer. It missed some big areas, though, including the potential costs of the tests and treatments for the disease, the quantification of the benefits, and any explanation of harms that would come from widespread screening for pancreatic cancer. It was stronger than a competing story from the Houston Chronicle about this study, and similar in quality to a competing LA Times piece. Pancreatic cancer is a deadly cancer that often presents insidiously. By the time of diagnosis the cancer is often advanced and incurable. There are no current screening tests for detecting early-stage cancer. A tumor marker that can both detect early cancer and monitor treated patients for cure/recurrence would potentially have great value."
"The eRumor has some factual problems. As far as we can tell from researching the life of Beethoven, it’s             misleading to set up the question by saying he would have been his             mother’s ninth birth. Only three of the children born to Maria Magdalena Beethoven             survived infancy, with the composer Ludvig Von  Beethoven being the oldest of             the three. Beethoven himself suffered from deafness in adulthood, but we found             no evidence of deaf, blind, or mentally retarded siblings as             children. We found no substantiation of Beethoven’s mother having had             syphilis. She is said to have died of what at that time was called consumption             or tuberculosis. Regarding candidate A, Franklin Roosevelt, there is talk among             astrologers that he consulted with astrologer Evangeline Adams, but             we have not been able to document that. We don’t know how many mistresses Franklin Roosevelt had but he had             an affair with his wife’s social secretary Lucy Page Mercer. She was with him when he died in 1945 in Warm Springs, Georgia. He did like his martinis and is credited with having been the first             to mix a martini in the White House and was a smoker. Regarding candidate B, Winston Churchill, according to             WinstonChurchill.org, he was known for his drinking. We could not find whether he used opium in college. Regarding candidate C, Adolph Hitler, it is true that there is no             evidence that he ever cheated on his wife but that’s primarily             because he was married to her for a few hours before both of them             committed suicide. Hitler’s and his longtime mistress Eva Braun got married early in             the morning on April 29, 1945. At about 3:30 the next afternoon, both took cyanide although Hitler             also shot himself in the head. Hitler preferred a vegetarian diet, but was not a pure vegetarian. It started when his doctor once put him on a vegetarian menu but             Hitler is described by his biographers as liking a variety of meats             including sausages. There is no record of Hitler having smoked or been a user of alcohol             and, in fact, he campaigned against the use of tobacco among his             troops. Comments",-1,mixture

Prevention of Genetic Breast Cancer Within Reach,0,"This news release covers new published research around the use of a drug — denosumab — as a preventative treatment for those women who might have a genetic disposition to a certain type of breast cancer, those who carry the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. While this multinational research news release presents the discovery as hopeful and exciting, the leap from rodent studies to humans is likely long, tenuous and far from certain. The news release treats the benefits and evidence found in the research somewhat vaguely, but over-reaches in describing the potential application of denosumab in preventing breast cancer. The release also claims that denosumab would be the first drug for preventing breast cancer, but Tamoxifen and raloxifene have already been approved for reducing breast cancer risk. The main contribution of this research is the role of a previously approved drug, denosumab in treating patients with a gene mutation that increases the likelihood of breast cancer. The research advances our knowledge of the breast cancer proteins RANKL and its receptor RANK, yet it bears to be seen how this mice-related research is going to apply to humans down the road. It is a little irresponsible to title a news release that “prevention of breast cancer is within reach” when the genetic anomaly that increases a woman’s risk of breast cancer is so rare in the population. The risk of a news release like this is that many women, fearful of breast cancer, may seek genetic testing and be subject to all its downstream consequences (dealing with false positives, the psychological impact and the stress and anxiety caused by the tests themselves). It needs to be emphasized that mutations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are rare and are linked to a very small fraction of all breast cancer. In the U.S., between one in 400 and one in 800 people in the general population have a BRCA1/2 mutation."

"First marijuana-derived drug approved, will target severe epilepsy",1,"This Washington Post article announces approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the first drug made directly from a compound found naturally in marijuana plants. It is meant to treat rare, genetic forms of severe childhood epilepsy, and the article goes to some lengths to make clear the FDA’s view that the approval does not constitute government support for marijuana in general, or for the growing commercial availability for self-prescribed medicinal use by the public. The news story further emphasizes that the marijuana compound — CBD — contains too little of the psychoactive part of the plant, THC, to cause the “high” associated with recreational use. The story would have been strengthened had it included a discussion about the evidence on which the FDA based its approval. It also doesn’t address the cost of the drug or the diverse and sometimes severe side effects identified in a substantial number of patients who participated in clinical trials, which also are not mentioned. For a comparison, see this recent 5-star review of a CNN story from May that looks at one of the studies that led to the approval. The FDA’s approval of this drug is highly newsworthy and will be of great interest not only for those seeking help for the rare seizure disorders the new drug, Epidiolex, is intended to treat, but also for other diseases and symptoms such as pain and nausea. At the same time, the FDA has come under increasing criticism for approving risky drugs without much evidence they work, making it vital that journalists scrutinize approvals."

New “morning-after” pill effective and safe: FDA staff,1,"By definition, emergency contraception is meant to be used only when other means of contraception fail. Controversy about emergency contraception typically centers around how it works – whether it prevents ovulation or blocks implantation of a fertilized egg. If emergency contraception works after fertilization, some would consider it an aborting agent. Regardless of its method of action, however, emergency contraception provides a safe and effective alternative to abortion. Although many women experience uncomfortable side effects from the medication, these are temporary and there are very few risks. In the US, the most commonly used emergency contraceptive is Plan B or levonogestrel. It contains the progestin commonly found in most birth control pills, but in much higher doses. Plan B acts to prevent ovluation. Mifeprex, or RU-486, can be used as an emergency contraceptive or aborting agent depending on when it is used. Last year, the EllaOne was approved for use in Europe and the UK. It has been shown to be effective for up to 5 days after contraceptive failure and has few side effects. Now, the FDA will meet to decide on its approval for use in the US. This story about EllaOne does not mention costs, does not adequately describe the strength of the available evidence to support the drug and does not provide quantification of the benefits or harms of the drug. And it doesn’t quote any independent sources outside of the FDA or the pharmaceutical company. Quoting independent sources to provide some perspective on what this might mean to women would have greatly improved this story. The absence of cost info, of comparisons to the most important alternatives (Plan B or Mifeprex), and of any sense of the scope of the benefits or harms were problems with this story. It was not clear that any independent vetting of claims took place."

The article reported this inaccurately as “The study out today found decaffeinated coffee is just as effective against diabetes as regular coffee, because both are loaded with the same nutrients.” In fact, the study found that while decaffeinated coffee was found to be associated with a statistically significant lower risk of developing type II diabetes, caffeinated coffee was not. The story did not address an obvious question: if coffee consumption is so beneficial for reducing the risk of developing type II diabetes, then why is the incidence of this disease on the rise at the same time that Americans are consuming more coffee? Nonethless, in a brief TV news story, ABC News covered many of the bases (and addressed a majority of our criteria)."

The Pill Protects Against Cancer,2,"This article reports on a significant study that quanitifies the link between taking oral contraceptives and a reduced risk of ovarian cancer. The news report has several key strengths:  It describes the methodology of the meta-analysis in considerable detail  It presents the size of the risk reduction in several ways–including the essential matter of how many women can expect to get ovarian cancer if they do or don’t take the pill It explores possible explanations for the reduction in risk, and contains necessary cautions about the drugs’ side effects It explains that women should not take the results to mean they should take oral contraceptives purely for the purposes of cancer risk reduction   The article also does a good job of putting the findings in a cultural context, indicating how many lives may have been saved, and how these effects are likely to spread to the developing world as more women there use oral contraceptives."
"Because the Federal Reserve recently cut interest rates to near 0%, “the Fed will be of little consequence now.

The Fed can telegraph its intentions about longer-term interest rates to reassure lenders and borrowers, and it can purchase assets such as short-term commercial IOUs to keep credit flowing, something the Fed has already begun doing. The Fed also has multiple ways to work with financial institutions to encourage lending and guarantee loans."
"Some with early-stage breast cancer can skip chemo, study says",2,"A study in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) looked into the most common type of breast cancer – early stage, without spread to lymph nodes and hormone positive, meaning the tumor’s growth is promoted by estrogen and/or progesterone. According to the Associated Press article on the study, more than 100,000 women in the US are diagnosed with this type. Doctors usually remove the tumor via surgery and prescribe hormone-blocking drugs, but they are unsure whether chemotherapy can offer additional benefits for some women. In this NEJM study, patients with this common breast cancer took a gene test to see whether their tumors would respond well to hormone-blocking drugs alone. Those labeled “low risk” based on this gene test skipped chemo and saw they had a very low rate of cancer recurrence within five years. The Associated Press article touches upon all the main points – costs of the gene test, study design and benefits, context – and we applaud how thoroughly the story addresses some of our criteria, especially on a tight deadline. Our main suggestion is to look for and report on conflicts of interest, especially if they concern the first author and are relevant to the study. In the US, breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women after skin cancer, with about 230,000 new cases diagnosed in women each year, according to the National Cancer Institute. Cancer treatments usually involve chemotherapy, which results in a long list of possible side effects and complications. In most cases, more than one drug is used, and patients could take these medications for years at a time. Not only that, cancer treatment drugs can be expensive. A typical weekly course of cancer drug Paclitaxel costs about $13,000, whereas the biweekly regimen is $23,000 to $40,000, according to one oncologist from Ohio’s Cleveland Clinic (login may be required). Any research that shows the benefits of forgoing chemotherapy could help patients avoid toxic side effects and complications and help curb the US’s epidemic of  “over care” and spiraling health care costs."

Scientists develop new type of HIV test on a USB stick,0,"Via Imperial College London and DNA Electronics This Reuters story draws readers in with news that scientists have developed a quick HIV test on a USB stick, which could be useful in the developing world. While the story hints at the underlying method —a unique lab-on-a-chip test to estimate the amount of HIV in a person—it glazes over the study’s two-test design. And it’s a big miss: The story confuses the effectiveness of the traditional, test tube-based method with that of the experimental USB stick test that researchers hope will replace it, ultimately overstating the latter’s sensitivity. The reason this happened is because it seems to be based entirely on a news release, which also seems to misunderstand the study’s design. But Reuters wasn’t alone; the Washington Post, International Business Times, Gizmodo, Live Science, and other outlets similarly relied on the press release and mischaracterized the study’s results. News outlets have a responsibility to report accurately on medical research, and go a step beyond the news release. In this case, it appears most news organizations dropped the ball. These inaccurate news stories could very well stoke false hope among HIV field workers and their patients, and further erode public trust in news media."

Beta Carotene Pills May Not Save Vision,2,"""Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a signficant problem in the elderly. It is a slow, progressive disease that can ultimately lead to blindness over time. Unfortunately, there are few options available for prevention or treatment and this story discusses new evidence showing no benefit in terms of prevent AMD from one option, beta carotene supplements. This story manages to provide the reader with adequate information on the problem of treating AMD and the strength of the available evidence to support the use of supplements. The story adequately describes the strength of the current study and points out some of the limitations. The story also mentions that there is some evidence that beta-carotene raises the risk of lung cancer in smokers, an important harm. The story adequately quantifies the benefit of supplements by providing the actual number of cases of AMD observed in the supplement group compared to the """"dummy pill"""" group. The story does mention that there is no cure for AMD (the """"dry"""" form) and that supplements are really the only option currently available. However, the story misses the main point of the scientific paper, which was that beta carotene supplementation does not appear to prevent AMD in people at usual risk for the disease. In contrast, there is evidence that antioxidant supplements (those tested contain beta carotene as a component) can be used to slow progression of AMD in those who have it. Overall, a good job, and in less than 500 words (496)."""
Pilot clinical trial finds injected immune cells safe in multiple myeloma patients,2,"This is a report of a phase I clinical trial testing whether specific immune cells harvested from the bone marrow, grown in the lab and then re-infused into multiple myeloma patients can effectively change the immune environment in the patient and suggest a possibly improved disease outcome. It looks at using a different population of immune cells — marrow-infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs) — from those used in previous studies. These are both easier to retrieve and easier to grow in the lab, two factors that reduce the complexity of this treatment approach. The release is in many ways a model for other organizations reporting on similar studies. The description of the study is clear, the language used appropriately conservative, and there is context regarding the novelty of the approach and current alternative treatments. Some discussion of possible costs — preliminary though it would have to be — would have completed the picture for readers. Rather than hyping such a study in a frenzied attempt to attract clicks and eyeballs, Hopkins presents the findings in a thoughtful way that reflects well on the institution’s reputation and will help build that reputation over the long haul. Multiple myeloma is one of several cancers of the blood and the National Cancer Institute estimates that nearly 27,000 new cases of myeloma will be diagnosed this year. Less than half of patients live as much as five years after their diagnosis, and more than 11,000 patients are expected to die from the disease this year. Any new approach to treating this and other blood cancers stands to benefit the nearly 90,000 patients now living with this disease in the U.S."

The article could have been improved by describing the strength of the evidence. For instance, the results are not based on a randomized trial, yet without this information or any other information about study design, readers don’t know how strong these results are. The article also could have included a discussion about absolute risks and benefits of colon cancer screening. While there is no obvious disease mongering, the absolute reduction in risk of dying from colon cancer due to screening is relatively small and some may find the risk or inconvenience of the procedure not worth the benefit. Similarly, presenting the option of not screening is always valid when discussing any screening program."

Celator Announces Phase 3 Trial for VYXEOS™ (CPX-351) in Patients with High-Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia Demonstrates Statistically Significant Improvement in Overall Survival,2,"Image shows blue-fluorescing Vyxeos nano-liposomes being engulfed by leukemia cells. Credit: Celator PharmaceuticalsThis is a company announcement of the results of a phase 3 trial of its new chemotherapy drug Vyxeos (cytarabine: daunorubicin) Liposome for Injection (also known as CPX-351) compared to the standard therapy (cytarabine and daunorubicin, or 7+3) in patients with high risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The study results have not yet been published. Despite the use of some exaggerated language over the implications of this study, and the lack of a cost reference, the news release delivered plenty of data about the benefits in the treatment group versus the comparator group. The release appears thorough in summarizing the study, although we can’t be sure since the results haven’t been made available for independent assessment. AML is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, where abnormal white blood cells grow rapidly and accumulate in the bone marrow, interfering with the production of normal blood cells. Any chemotherapy advance that can extend the lives of patients with high risk AML without adverse drug effects is highly welcomed. It is possible that the liposome formulation of these two previously used chemotherapies will help patients survive longer than other therapies and be an advance in a disease where there are very few options and low survival rates. It’s important to assess this release now since the manufacturer indicated it plans to seek U.S. and European regulatory approval for the drug this year. It should be pointed out that the Vyxeos injection appears to combine the same drugs used in the standard therapy, but with a nano particle liposomal membrane package delivery system."
New Product Is First to Claim It May Reduce Peanut Allergies,2,"This New York Times story covers the health claims of Hello, Peanut!, a powdered peanut product that allows parents to gradually expose their infants to peanuts, in accordance with pediatricians’ and allergists’ advice that the practice reduces the risk of children developing peanut allergies. The recently released, updated medical advice promoting early exposure to peanuts is a complete reversal from the American Academy of Pediatrics’ previous guidelines, which said that high-risk infants should avoid peanuts up to age 3. New guidelines are based on the results of one study conducted in 628 infants at high risk for peanut allergy, which found that early introduction of peanuts significantly decreased the frequency of the development of peanut allergy and modulated immune responses to peanuts. The story covers the science behind the change as well as a range of reactions concerning the new product and its qualified health claim. The story was strong on many points, though we wished it had better explained what a qualified health claim is, and why changing guidelines based on one study can be risky. While the story details the study that the qualified health claim is based on, it does not help readers understand how to interpret that limited evidence."

Doctors suggest that women hit pause button on osteoporosis drugs,1,"This story about drug treatments for osteoporosis positions itself as a careful re-analysis of the benefits and harms of a class of drugs known as bisphosphonates. So we were surprised to find that this story suffers from some of the same deficiencies that typically plague boosterish puff pieces. Particularly problematic in this story is the lack of quantitative data. We learn that the use of bisphosphonate drugs is becoming more limited due to increasing awareness of frightening side effects, such as cancer and jaw necrosis. Yet there is no accounting in the story of how often these harms occur or how effective the drugs are for preventing fractures. There also were significant gaps in the coverage of costs and in the disclosure of potential financial conflicts. Despite its considerable shortcomings, the story gets credit for framing the issue in an appropriately cautious way and for soliciting a variety of expert perspectives. Readers should come away from the story with a generally accurate, if incomplete, understanding of the issue. There is evidence that long-term use of bisphosphonates can increase the risk for a number of rare but potentially serious adverse effects. How long women should continue taking these drugs is an open question that researchers urgently need to address."

Study: Rapidly rising PSA signals more aggressive prostate cancer,1,"""The story describes a new study that uses PSA velocity – how rapidly a prostate specific antigen level rises – to predict which men will have aggressive prostate cancers that may benefit from earlier treatment. The article does a nice job of recognizing some of the controversy surrounding prostate cancer screening. That is, many prostate cancers are slow growing and will never threaten a man's life and it's unclear whether screening and early treatment of prostate cancer saves lives. The article also nicely includes independent sources of information, specifically a physician who cautions readers about the value of PSA velocity, to help provide balance to the story. However, the story does not adequately describe the evidence for the findings, namely that the study is not a randomized controlled trial, so does not prove using PSA velocity can save lives. The researcher is quoted saying """"This is a test that doesn't just diagnose prostate cancer. It diagnoses prostate cancer that's going to actually cause harm."""" But the results that are reported do not support this enthusiastic, evidence-free statement. Another limitation is not describing alternative screening options, including the decision not to be screened at all. Finally, the story does not mention that screening itself is associated with harms, such as physical pain from subsequent biopsies, anxiety, and problems related to a false positive (a false alarm) screening result. While the story does mention that many experts believe too many men are undergoing side effect prone treatments for prostate cancers which would never harm them,  those treatments or side effects are  not mentioned. The treatments commonly include surgery or radiation, both of which can cause problems with impotence/erections, bladder control, and bowel functioning.

Little attention is given to the fact that few people with back pain are actually candidates for surgery and that it is still unclear whether people end up better off than if they had chosen a non-surgical route. This ABC news story does a decent job of describing these controversies, although the story is flawed in several ways. The story provides good information on how the likelihood of having the surgery in the U.S. is so much higher than in other countries. Although the story mentions spinal fusion and physical therapy as alternatives to discectomy, the story should have discussed other options and the pros and cons of each option. The story explains that there is not good evidence that surgery is better than non-surgical therapy. However, the story should have further described the strength of the available evidence. The story does not quantify the benefit of treatment, does not explain if laparoscopic surgery is novel or not, does not mention costs, and other than to say that sugery is often unnecessary, the story does not discuss harms of treatment, which can be substantial.

We’ve published dozens of blog posts and systematic reviews on proton beam therapy; many of which focus on media messages from a single hospital that has invested in the very expensive technology. Using an individual patient to shed light on a form of cancer treatment is not uncommon; focusing on the individual gives readers someone to relate to. However, it is important for news releases or news stories to go beyond individual anecdotes and provide readers with information they can use to make informed decisions about their own treatment options. How expensive is this form of treatment? What are the potential side effects? How effective is it? This release provides no information that readers could apply to their own circumstances. The question in this instance is: why did the care provider deem this to be worthy of a news release?

According to a report from the National Institutes of Health’s 2002 State-of-the-Science Conference on Symptom Management in Cancer: Pain, Depression, and Fatigue, “The clinical ‘rule of thumb’ is that 25 percent of cancer patients are likely depressed enough at some point in the course of disease to warrant evaluation and treatment.” Again, that depression affects not only the patients, but their loved ones. This makes it especially important for research institutions and news outlets to write responsibly about studies like those discussed in this release. You want to give readers enough information to help them make informed decisions. You don’t want to raise false hopes, or sensationalize the work. This release does a very good job of handling a delicate subject well."

Treatment brings hope for ovarian cancer,2,"In this story we learn of one of the most important recent advances in the treatment of ovarian cancer. In a randomized trial, intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy extended survival by 16 months compared to standard chemotherapy in women with stage 3 ovarian cancer. It is such an important finding that, in a rare move, the National Cancer Institute issued a statement calling for a change in clinical practice. This AP story adequately represents the prevalence and seriousness of ovarian cancer. The story adequately presents the alternative treatment option (intravenous chemotherapy) and the advantages and disadvantages of the new approach. The clinical evidence is presented accurately (although they did not mention that this was a randomized trial) and the benefits of treatment are presented for both intravenous and intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The story is especially strong in frankly portraying the harms and side effects of treatment, which were so bad that most women in the study were not able to complete the full course of treatment. The author does present a second opinion from an independent source. However, the story did not explain whether or not this treatment is novel, how widely available it is (and, by extension, how many practicitioners are experienced administering the treatment), and the costs or cost-effectiveness. Another major limitation of the story is that they did not attempt to place this treatment within the context of the overall picture of ovarian cancer. This study involved women with stage 3 ovarian cancer. What percentage of ovarian cases does that represent? What does that mean for women who are more/less advanced? The story leaves the reader thinking this treatment would be used for any woman with ovarian cancer, when in reality, we don’t know if it could help women who are more or less advanced than the study population. Presumably it would not be appropriate for early stage disease given the toxicity of the treatment, but what about later stages (which represent a large portion of ovarian cancer patients)?"

‘Miracle Patient’ Finds New Hope with Breast Cancer Vaccine,0,"This news release highlights the “miracle” response of a single patient with triple-negative breast cancer to a drug combination that included an experimental cancer vaccine and a biosimilar of the drug pembrolizumab (marketed as Keytruda). Far from objective, the release relies on strong emotional language such as “remarkable,” “miracle” and “shocking” to make the case for the drug combo instead of solid evidence and quantified benefits. The release also makes a pitch to breast cancer patients to become hospital clients, and to pharmaceutical companies to fund future clinical trials of the drug combo. The release is premature. It’s based on a single case. There’s been no long-term follow-up and researchers say they don’t know which element of the treatment may have benefited the patient. We’ve profiled City of Hope’s penchant for “miracle mongering” previously on HealthNewsReview.org. Highlighting a single person’s preliminary reaction — she had not yet even completed the treatment — to an experimental drug combination and calling it a miracle creates a false and biased narrative of the true effectiveness of this treatment. The release noted that in previous patients with different types of cancer, no clinical benefit was seen with the drug combination and in this single case study, researchers weren’t sure what caused the patient’s improvement."

Menopause Therapy Sparks Controversy,1,"This broadcast piece does a reasonable job of framing the use of custom-mixed 'bioidentical' hormones as an alternative to commercially available hormone therapies for relieving menopausal symptoms. However, it relies exclusively on interviews, and does not tell the whole story about the available evidence on these products. While it's true that botanical products are not regulated or approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), many have been tested in clinical trials both in the United States and in Europe–and the evidence that they relieve menopausal symptoms is somewhat less positive than the story suggests. An interview with a woman who found they did not relieve her symptoms, or more information about the evidence, would have provided some important balance. Similarly, concerns about their risks are primarily theoretical, because to date there have not been large-scale studies of their harms. Dr. Schwartz's statement that profit motives explain the lack of these studies goes unchallenged. What's more, it's a bit disingenuous, given that 'Dr. Erika' herself runs a website marketing both her books and her 'exclusive' supplements (www.DrErika.com)."

"Studies show that for kids’ ear infections, antibiotics work better than waiting",0,"Overall, we reviewed four pieces on this study. All the others (CNN, LA Times, NPR) got four star reviews. We appreciate that journalists sometimes want to bring their own perspective to a story, and we think this can provide valuable context when the reporter approaches the issue carefully. In this blog post about the use of antibiotics to treat children’s ear infections, however, the writer prioritizes her own experience and conclusions while ignoring important evidence and failing to seek out the perspective of any real expert. And so the story provides a lopsided and overly simplified account of an issue that demands more balanced coverage and careful consideration of benefits and harms. Read the CNN blog post for what we think is a fair comparison – blog to blog, head to head. This blog piece suggests that antibiotics are more effective than placebos for treating middle ear infections in infants and toddlers — a conclusion supported by two new randomized controlled trials reported in the respected New England Journal of Medicine. While useful to know, this information isn’t enough to tell us how all children with ear infections should be treated. To make these kinds of treatment choices, it’s also important to consider how much more effective antibiotics are than no treatment, and we should be aware that the benefits might depend on how confident the doctor is in the diagnosis (viral colds and other problems often look like ear infections, but won’t benefit from treatment). We also need to weigh the downsides of treatment, which include adverse effects such as diarrhea as well as the potential for increased risk of future infections with antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. After considering all of these factors, different parents may come to different decisions about whether they want to treat their child immediately with an antiobiotic or reserve treatment for a brief period while waiting to see if he gets better on his own. Reporters don’t do parents any favors when they encourage them to make knee jerk decisions about a child’s care, as this blog did."

Study says late angioplasty futile,2,"The story reports on new research that shows angioplasty performed late after a heart attack (defined as 3 to 28 days) does not improve survival, chance of another heart attack, or chance of heart failure compared to taking medications alone in a subset of people. The story does a nice job of describing the current culture surrounding late angioplasty, that is, it is currently routinely done but that this new research questions that practice. This is the first randomized controlled trial of this clinical situation (as opposed to observational studies) and the results are surprising, which is described by the article. The article also describes the benefit and harm (the trend toward an increase in risk for heart attack with angioplasty) in absolute terms, which is refreshing. A criterion that was not met was the inclusion of cost information. While the article states angioplasty is expensive, it's not clear what the costs are or that medications are less expensive over a lifetime. Cost information could have made this a stronger story, but overall, the article does a nice job of meeting the vast majority of criteria."
"Chemo damages brain, study finds",1,"This story presented some recent research results that in one case documents cognitive effects of chemotherapy and in the other pathologic changes in an animal model following exposure to chemotherapy. The information in these studies provides evidence of a previously under-appreciated side effect of chemotherapy. Importantly, however, the story does not provide adequate balance of these harms by including background about the beneficial role that chemotherapy often plays, not uncommonly resulting in years of living. Reporting scientific evidence on a problem reported by patients that is dismissed by clinicians may be useful to patients and their families. This information may improve patient management of the situation by allowing them to plan more appropriately for the period after chemotherapy with the particular drugs studied. An important omission from this story was a cautionary note that this side effect was observed following treatment with particular chemotherapy. It is not known at this time whether the use of other chemotherapy agents also results in this side effect. The opening sentences are a bit inflammatory and not supported by the information presented. The Inagaki study suggested a temporary issue with cognition and brain structure. The Noble experiment was done in a test tube and in mice and may or may not relate to humans – a point that was not emphasized. The dose of drugs used was not well described in the Noble article relative to those achieved during standard chemotherapy. It would be easy for a reader to walk away with the impression that chemotherapy kills brain cells more than tumor cells based on this reporting. This story serves as useful information about a potential side effect, which has value to patients as they work to make informed treatment decisions."
Study links finger length to prostate cancer risk,0,"This story fails on many levels:  failing to make even one comment on the limitations of observational studies; failing to comment on the limitations of this particular study method (a questionnaire and self-assessment); allowing a researcher to claim that this approach “could be used as a simple test for prostate cancer” without challenging that comment. And, while a brief comment was made about prostate cancer screening being “controversial,” the story never explained that the US Preventive Services Task Force concludes that there’s insufficient evidence to weigh the balance of harms and benefits in prostate cancer screening in men younger than 75. But the story did allow a researcher to say this test could be particularly useful in men under 60. The failure to evaluate the limitations of the evidence and the failure to challenge researchers’ bold claims made this an example of stenography more than an example of journalism."

Blood Test Finds Cancer Before Symptoms Start,2,"This NBC News story reports on a new approach to a blood test that might reveal early-stage cancers by detecting altered DNA floating in the bloodstream. Researchers reported an impressive success rate in finding markers that indicate cancer, although the test still needs refinement. For that reason, we think it was too early for the story to say the test can detect cancer “before symptoms start,” as so far it has mostly only been tested among people with confirmed cancer. But the story does a good job mentioning the considerable costs of required genetic testing, and touches on potential conflicts of interest among the researchers. It outlines some of the potential risks as well as the benefits of the proposed test, and adequately explains that it is not yet ready for prime time. One area that could have been stronger is conveying the reality that early detection does not guarantee a longer, healthier, cancer-free life, a point we raise frequently. Cancer screening (by definition, in asymptomatic patients) is complex and costly. It requires fairly complex tracking by physicians and practices, and for patients to undergo often unpleasant procedures. Because we screen for many cancers in healthy adults after a certain age, and some of those screenings require specialty involvement (colonoscopy by gastroenterology, mammogram readings by radiology) this testing adds up. A single blood test that can detect early-stage cancers (many of them at once) would be a big improvement in cancer screening. But care must be taken by journalists not to rush ahead of the science. This story kept a cautious tone."

Prenatal testing can detect cancer in pregnant mothers,0,"This CBS story is about the detection of maternal cancers during analysis of DNA blood tests designed to identify chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus. Understandably, the story focuses on the story of a mother who feels her unborn fetus may have “saved her life” because of the unexpected cancer finding. It packs a significant emotional punch for such a very short story and very likely collected a lot of eyeballs. But it missed an opportunity to offer viewers some context and background about the potential risks as well as benefits from wider use of DNA blood tests that reveal incidental findings that suggest disease. The competing WSJ story was longer and provided more of the details we were looking for. There is increasing demand by physicians and pregnant women to perform noninvasive prenatal blood tests as a safer means of establishing fetal risk for Down Syndrome and other serious genetic abnormalities. Although professional guidelines suggest that only women at high risk of carrying fetuses with serious genetic abnormalities get these tests, they are already widely used because other procedures, such as amniocentesis, can occasionally lead to miscarriage. The discovery that in a few rare cases, the abnormalities detected in the tests have nothing to do with the fetus, but with a mother’s undiagnosed cancer instead, will likely lead to even more demand for use of these tests. That poses not only the ethical problem of whether and when to divulge incidental genetic risks also uncovered in maternal DNA (say, of breast cancer), but also a potential explosion of costs related to use of the blood tests to screen every pregnant woman to find a very small number of cancers."

The selling of statins is already quite successful without journalism adding to the marketing frenzy by passing along wholesale the claims that appear in university news releases – from talks at scientific meetings that have not been rigorously peer-reviewed – without adding an independent voice to the story – and then framing the benefits in the more impressive-sounding relative (not absolute) risk reduction terms.

"Multigene test may find risk for heart disease, diabetes and breast cancer",1,"This Associated Press story describes a new approach aimed at analyzing genetic data to assess the risk to patients of developing five specific diseases, and giving people a “polygenic score.” The new approach looks at multiple genes at the same time, and the role they play, in developing these diseases. Many current genetic tests focus on seeking individual genes that have been changed. The story needed more caution–there are plenty of unknowns here. For example, even if a person knows their score, there’s no proof that having that number will improve health outcomes. What, for example, should a person do if they find out they’re at high risk for heart disease, but don’t have any signs of it? Also, false-positive and false-negative results could be significant. Predicting a person’s risk for serious and life-threatening diseases is valuable, both to the individual and to public health. So any refined improvement in how we gauge that risk is a true benefit. But this story uses the findings from one effort looking at a British database and extrapolates too broadly without offering readers the kinds of information they need to gauge whether there is great promise here, or just more hype."

New research ranks the effectiveness of nonsurgical treatments for knee osteoarthritis,1,"This news release clearly describes the key findings of a comparison study of several nonsurgical treatments for knee osteoarthritis in a way that is likely to be useful to patients. However, the brevity of the release and the methods of the underlying meta-analysis mean that readers are not given specifics about the absolute clinical benefits of the treatments, only their relative rankings. There is only a brief, general mention of potential harms of some of the drugs included in the analysis. The release says that almost half of Americans are at risk of developing knee osteoarthritis. This eye-catching number comes straight from the journal article, but it is far higher than other estimates and is based on a study of only the older residents of single rural county in North Carolina. Sophisticated statistical methods for combining the results of multiple clinical trials, such as the network meta-analysis used in this case, are powerful tools for discerning larger, more useful, conclusions from the results of many smaller research efforts. However, the very power of these methods imposes a substantial responsibility on the researchers to perform the work capably and carefully… and then a subsequent responsibility on journalists reporting the story to seek out independent sources who are qualified to comment on the work."

Tweaking brains with ‘smart drugs’ to get ahead in Silicon Valley,1,"This story about purported brain-boosting pills would have been easier to swallow if it came with a stronger shot of skepticism. The story would have benefited greatly from at least one source who isn’t involved in the cognitive-enhancement movement. It does a better job of describing the availability of these supplements and the hyper-competitive culture that feeds this emerging market. The term “nootropics” applies to a wide variety of substances that apparently require no safety or efficacy trials, no FDA approval, and no prescription from a doctor. As a result, media coverage is often consumers’ only tool to counter the marketing hype when attempting to determine whether these products will do them good or harm, or simply waste their money. Sadly critical coverage is in short supply. Back in 2015, HealthNewsReview.org Associate Editor Kathlyn Stone wrote that nootropics were “under the radar” of journalists, despite heavy marketing targeted at students and young professionals. That appears to be changing, but journalists need to be cognizant of their role as consumer watchdogs."
Study: Avidâ€™s Imaging Dye Can Detect Alzheimerâ€™s From Scan,1,"The story provides little information about the benefits or harms of the compound, only that the company making the compound intends to submit it for approval to the FDA in the next 6 months. Even if the WSJ reported on scanning research back in April, readers needed a little more meat in this updated story. Although there are no effective treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease, the ability to diagnose the disorder early and prior to the development of symptoms opens doors to new research. An early diagnosis would allow researchers to test new approaches to slowing the inevitable decline of the disease and would allow those who otherwise would be inaccurately diagnosed to rule the disorder out. However – the story did not provide readers with sufficient context for evaluating the actual benefit from early diagnosis."

The story explained that the study followed those who were non-emergency heart patients and that angioplasty is still thought to be the best treatment for those having a heart attack or those w ho are hospitalized with worsening symptoms.

MRI technique differentiates benign breast lesions from malignancies,0,"Mammography screening for detection of breast cancer produces a lot of false positive findings. This means that many women are subjected to unnecessary breast biopsy procedures. This news release reports on a study in which the authors argue that false-positives prior to biopsy may be reduced by using a procedure called diffusion kurtosis imaging. This technique relies on information provided by MRIs performed as a supplement to mammograms. Diffusion kurtosis imaging provides information on tissue structures at a microscopic level that can be read via a software algorithm rather than by human technicians. Given that malignant lesions affect tissue structures at this level, it is suggested that this technique might serve as a relevant marker of changes. False positives are frightening for patients and lead to increased diagnostic costs. Reducing the number of them seems like a laudable goal, and a software algorithm to assess imaging would be less invasive than biopsy procedures. The news release is careful to state that the new approach is not being presented as a substitute for current MRI protocols that use contrast-imaging to detect malignancies. The lead author emphasizes that diffusion kurtosis imaging is simply another diagnostic option, and that findings must be subjected to larger scale studies. All of this is straightforward. It does, however, beg the question of why these findings are worth reporting in a news release. At HealthNewsReview.org we regularly see releases and articles describing results of early stage trials and pilot studies which may not hold up in larger trials and which are years away from widespread implementation. Information in such studies is certainly worth disseminating to the scientific community as knowledge about a particular issue is painstakingly being constructed. However, to flood the broader public with preliminary results runs the risk of raising false expectations or inuring them to significant developments when they arise."

Second, Wise also claimed that """"in every domestic violence agency, every law enforcement agency"""" a meeting like that would be """"a no-no."""" That’s for the most part correct as well, though experts we spoke to questioned whether it’s the right parallel to draw. Questioning victims separately from suspects in domestic violence cases does appear to be a widespread practice both encouraged by domestic violence advocates and many police and state policies after an incident occurs. But Goodell was not conducting a criminal investigation -- that already had occurred, and he had access to that information. Also, there are occasions when couples involved in domestic violence cases are interviewed together later, allowing police and prosecutors to judge how they act with one another so they can assess credibility and potential prosecution, one expert told us. Setting aside whether the comparison is apt, Wise’s claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."""
Type 1 diabetes treatment could end need for insulin shots,0,"This news story is about a new technology being developed in the UK that will grow pancreatic islet cells in a lab, as a possible treatment for type 1 diabetes patients. There is news here: A consortium of non-profit, university, government funding and private investment is moving forward to bring hope to potentially tens of thousands of people with Type 1 diabetes. But the story itself is problematic on several levels–it appears to be little more than a rehash of the news release, making a passing mention to successful “pre-clinical results” but offering no specifics. There is no discussion of the realities: Islet transplants are costly, carry adverse effects, can fail, and are complex to manage. How will this therapy differ? We’re not told. Type I diabetes, which starts in childhood, is life shortening, life threatening and notoriously difficult to manage and control. A novel technology that could directly provide huge numbers of lab-grown islets–which make insulin–does hold promise for helping Type 1 diabetics, though much, much more research is needed before we’ll know if this is the case."

Heart CT Scans Outperform Stress Tests in Spotting Clogged Arteries,1,"This release from Johns Hopkins describes results from a head-to-head comparison study that found computed tomography (CT) scans of the heart’s vessels outperformed single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) stress tests in detecting clogged arteries. The analysis came from a trial that compared how well the two noninvasive imaging techniques (CT scans and SPECT stress tests) matched up with invasive coronary angiography. A quick read of this news release could erroneously lead readers to believe the current standard initial imaging test for a blocked heart artery, SPECT stress testing, should be immediately tossed aside in favor of CT angiography, and that the switch would improve heart attack prevention. While the release had several strengths, it inflated the benefits and soft-pedaled study limitations. Our reviewers suggest the findings are of modest importance because while identifying blocked arteries is important, the bigger question is: What is the prognosis (what will happen to me if I don’t do anything differently?) and how should patients be treated? Identifying blocked vessels is part of that, but it doesn’t provide a complete picture. The release doesn’t mention that elements of the standard stress test, unlike the CT scan, can help predict prognosis. The release presumes that finding blocked arteries is the goal when really what patients and providers need to know is whether or not to undergo additional interventions. About 15 million Americans seek medical attention each year for chest pain, shortness of breath and extreme fatigue — symptoms that may signal a clogged artery. A study that definitively showed that one non-invasive imaging test outperformed another in accurately detecting clogged arteries would be of wide interest. However, one study rarely changes clinical practice. And even when results clearly indicate a newer test does a better job of measuring what it measures, that doesn’t necessarily mean it will automatically improve the health of patients. News releases shouldn’t confuse advancing the ball with scoring a touchdown."

OrCam helps the blind math teacher 'see' again,1,"The OrCam deviceThis story is basically a testimonial about a math teacher whose medical condition — Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy — left her with impaired vision.

There’s no discussion of evidence (it’s unclear if there is, in fact, any evidence on this device), and the benefits described by the woman in the story may not be representative of broader experience with it. The story needed to dig deeper and more widely to give readers an accurate portrait of this technology. For people whose vision suddenly deteriorates, any aid which provides them with either a fix for the situation or an alternative method of “seeing” is a huge plus for their quality of life. In the case cited in this story, the OrCam apparently provided that for this individual. But whether such benefits are experienced more broadly is an open question that this story doesn’t attempt to answer."

New FAU study suggests benefits of regular mammography extend to the elderly,0,"Researcher Charles H. Hennekens, MD looms large in this news release — perhaps larger than the study itself.This news release issued on behalf of a prestigious researcher — one said to have “saved more than 1.1 million lives” according to Science Heroes — claims the evidence is in that regular mammograms after age 74 save lives. But does the evidence presented really show that? We expected to see many different studies and opinions released when the USPTF announced its final recommendations on screening with mammograms, and we were not disappointed. This release raises some important points but it also seems to be touting the professional reputation of the study’s senior author (ranked ahead of Jonas Salk in terms of lifesaving prowess!) when it should have devoted more space to cost and limitations, and making a stronger case for the benefits and evidence. After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women across all races and ethnicities. Some health experts are challenging the stubborn view that more frequent and technically advanced screening is necessary to confront breast cancer, and have become very vocal in educating the public about the harms of over-diagnosis and erroneous diagnosis (false positives). This release matters now because the study it informs us about indirectly challenges the findings (some might say non-findings) of the newly released US Preventative Services Task Force final recommendations for mammography screening in women. (In a Q&A on the new recs, the USPsTF says about mammograms for senior women: “For women age 75 and older, the evidence of the overall benefit of mammography screening is unclear, and the Task Force is unable to make a recommendation for or against screening.”) This study by Florida Atlantic University looked at Medicare claims data and came out with a recommendation that elderly women should continue to get regular mammograms. We can assume this release, based on a study published in July 2015, came out this week to coincide with and contribute to the discussion about the USPSTF final recommendations."

The diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish and low-fat dairy products while limiting fats, sodium and sugars. Today it is frequently recommended as a healthy daily diet plan for everyone. HealthDay’s story on the top ranking diet regurgitates the “who” and “what” as found in USN&WR’s news release but doesn’t describe any of the evidence supporting the different diets or give us any hard numbers on benefits. If HealthDay is going to cover what is basically a story from another news outlet, you’d think they want to add depth and context to the coverage rather than just parrot the source news release. Complications from diabetes, heart disease and a host of other health conditions are often made worse, or even caused, by poor diet and nutrition habits. Encouraging widespread adoption of diets that are backed by sound, long-term studies is a positive public health service. The DASH diet, among others, has been shown to lower blood pressure and help people maintain a healthy weight. Identifying diets that can meet these two goals and also be easy to follow is important for a healthy lifestyle."

Blood Test Predicts Treatment Response and Survival for Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer,0,"This news release touted a study that showed a blood test for a biomarker called AR-V7 can identify patients with aggressive prostate cancer who would benefit if they switched from hormone therapy to chemotherapy.

In fact, it’s unclear whether this test actually extends patients’ lives. A blood test to inform treatment decisions for aggressive prostate cancer could save money, spare patients from ineffective and toxic treatments, and extend lives.

This HealthDay story on a new study indicating potential cancer prevention benefits from bone density drugs — quoted Dr. Gad Rennert, the study’s lead author, sounding “These [new] findings are meaningful because they point to a possible protective effect of this class of drugs being relevant to prevention of many different cancers. … This is [similar] to the effect that we and others have shown for [cholesterol-lowering] statins.” From there on, Rennert is allowed to pump up the benefits of these drugs and to sweep aside any concern about their risks or broad application to a large population. Contrast that with the Reuters Health story which chose to quote Eric Jacobs from the American Cancer Society saying, “The lower risk of colorectal cancer risk seen among bisphosphonate users in this study is intriguing….However, these results should be interpreted with caution and require confirmation by additional studies.” From that point on, the story took a cautious, objective look at the study’s findings. We wish both stories had done a better job parsing the evidence, but we think that, overall, Reuters Health provided better context for readers. Roughly 1 out of every 20 people in the US will develop colorectal cancer at current rates. If taking a simple pill for $10 a month can keep cancer at bay, the world would be a much better place. Because solutions to significant health challenges are usually not that simple, this story and others that covered the same study should have been more cautious in explaining the results and showing readers why they might not translate to an immediate benefit for them."

Dyslexia: Scanning the brain for clues,2,"This story is the best of the three we reviewed about a study indicating that brain scans may help researchers understand brain structure and function in people who have dyslexia. It refrains from claiming that the work has near-term clinical implications for people who have trouble reading and writing. However, the bulk of the story is made up of personal stories about living with dyslexia, while key features of this research are buried deep in the story or left out entirely. What’s more, the story describes the study participants as “children,” thus leaving readers with the impression that researchers looked at beginning readers, when they actually were studying teenagers who presumably had been dealing with dyslexia for many years. In addition, the story tosses in a discussion of an unrelated study of dyslexia and spatial skills. Even people with advanced reading skills are likely to come away from this story befuddled about the scope, findings and implications of the research. Good reading skills are fundamental to educational, social and financial success. Dyslexia is a type of reading disability characterized by difficulties in word recognition, spelling and decoding. Most studies suggest early intervention is important, but little is known about why some children respond better than others. This research suggests that brain scans can provide insight to underlying mechanisms of dyslexia and perhaps help track and refine interventions that could be tailored to individuals. But for readers to understand the value of this study, stories must clearly describe the research and its implications."

Melatonin reduces blood pressure and tunes up disrupted circadian rhythms in the elderly,0,"In a small study of nearly 100 residents of a facility for the elderly, Russian researchers found that low doses of melatonin every night for two weeks reduced participants’ blood pressure levels and rendered circadian rhythms “less irregular.”  While the study, albeit modest in size, has both strengths and weaknesses (for example, it utilized a control group but did not appear to “blind” the researchers to treatment/nontreatment conditions), the findings reflect patterns that have been well established by researchers over the years concerning melatonin and circadian rhythms. We’re concerned that the release doesn’t point out the serious complications that can arise when taking melatonin with other drugs, particularly since the elderly are the most likely to be on multiple medications, including drugs for high blood pressure. Among the frustrations of aging is increased difficulty sleeping, driven in part by fluctuations in blood pressure levels. This small, brief study does not establish whether melatonin is of value in treating either insomnia or fluctuating blood pressure.

Ovarian Tissue Transplant Can Help Some Women Have Kids After Cancer Treatment Researchers in Denmark report a success rate of about 30 percent,2,"A small European study showed 31 percent of cancer patients had successful pregnancies after they received transplants of their own (once removed and frozen) ovarian tissue.

We also quibble with one researcher’s description of the size of the benefit. The suggestion that “many” women will get pregnant using this procedure is somewhat misleading. The procedure led to a successful pregnancy in less than a third of the women who received it. Having children is an emotional and cultural touchstone for both men and women. Cancer patients have long suffered infertility because of harsh drugs and radiation therapies. This study raises hopes that by taking some ovarian tissue before treatment, some women can eventually get that organ re-implanted and become pregnant."

Vaccine shows promising results for early-stage breast cancer patients,0,"This news release covers a randomized trial of 54 women with early-stage breast tumors that studied the safety and efficacy of a vaccine that uses messenger cells in the immune system, called dendritic cells, to target a protein on cancer cells. The study’s main goal was to compare the safety and immune responses using varying routes of vaccination, including a lymph node, a breast tumor, or both. The news release quantifies some benefits and mentions harms, but it doesn’t spell out costs, availability or study limitations, leaving the reader to wonder why these findings are significant. The headline of a “promising” treatment for early stage breast cancer patients isn’t supported by the facts. News releases that don’t spell out study limitations are bound to spawn misleading replications across the internet, particularly when they purport to advance the idea of harnessing the body’s immune system to fight cancer. That’s the case here, where we found numerous online blurbs based on this news release, such as: “Vaccine Shows Promising Results for Early-Stage Breast Cancer Patients: Moffitt Cancer Center is working on a new vaccine that would help early-stage breast cancer patients who have HER2 positive disease.” The bottom line: there’s no evidence that this procedure produces a long-term benefit such as reduced mortality. All but one patient who responded to this treatment had been diagnosed with a noninvasive condition called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which poses a very low risk of death from breast cancer. Further, this study was designed mainly to compare various paths of vaccination, not to determine the broader question of whether the treatment actually saves lives."

The Healthy Skeptic: DHA touted as ‘smart’ pill for kids,1,"We typically love the Healthy Skeptic column and truly look forward to its thoughtful analysis of health claims being made for various products and treatments. In this piece about DHA supplements, though, we felt there wasn’t enough hard-hitting skepticism. The story did a great job explaining the supplements themselves and discussing the way they are marketed. It also provided good cost information. Most importantly, it presented strong evidence to counter the claims that DHA makes kids smarter. That evidence, however, was undercut by the only two people quoted in the story. Two medical doctors who give their own children DHA. These experts essentially say that kids should take the supplements even if the evidence supporting its benefit is weak. The article quotes one of these experts saying, “There’s no downside to it.” Glossing over potential risks and touting uNPRoven benefits are usually areas where the Healthy Skeptic finds fault. We fear this story will become yet another piece of marketing for an health supplement that has no documented health benefit. Young children don’t make most diet choices for themselves, and they certainly don’t buy themselves health supplements. Parents understandably want to help their children succeed in school, and if they see a possible brain booster in a product such as a DHA supplement, they are going to buy it, especially if they see the product being touted in the Los Angeles Times and other mainstream publications. The Times owes it to its readers to be more critical of these products and to help parents understand what reasonable steps they can take to help their children do well in school without taking an unnecessary pill."

Inexplicably, the story includes no response from the Task Force itself. So a clear imbalance exists in the story. Indeed, a flip side to the story that there’s a decline in 40-year old women getting mammograms is that this is a good thing. But the story never even hints at that possibility. When given the choice, one of these studies suggests that most women in their 40s continue with mammograms. The shared decision-making angle to the story is missed.

Doctors hope newer versions of artificial ankles will better mimic nature’s joint,1,"This news story attempts to explain the treatment options available for people who have severely disabling pain caused by osteoarthritis of the ankle. The article is generously sprinkled with both hope and caveats about the newest generation of ankle replacement implants intended to improve life for people like patient Dan Sivia: “Specialists hope… although it’s too soon to be sure.” “If the newer implants pan out…” “There is little research to tell how long newer versions will last…” Despite this attempt at even-handedness, however, readers are left with a fuzzy understanding of the potential harms of ankle replacements, little hard data about their potential benefits, virtually no understanding of the quality of the evidence on this topic, and no mention of a key source’s potential conflicts of interest. Are there any randomized trials comparing 3rd-generation ankle replacement to nonsurgical treatments or fusion or any other treatments? If not, are there large cohort studies? Small case series? What are the limitations of the evidence? What exactly do we know about the clinical outcomes of the new implants? What proportion of patients report less pain and improved mobility? How many fail? (See “Quantification of Benefits of Treatment” criterion.) What are the short- and long-terms harms associated with ankle replacement? (See “Harms of Treatment” above.) This is not a simple procedure and complications are an important outcome. What does it mean for an ankle replacement to fail, other than the need for “additional surgeries on your ankle in the future”? Can a failed implant usually be converted to an ankle fusion without problems? (There is some research to suggest that this is often the case.) Given that the new generation of implants were approved in 2005, does that mean there are no published data on their durability beyond a year or two? Is there any precedent in the development of other weight-bearing joint replacements (hip, knee) to suggest that outcomes improve after an implant is re-engineered to “work more like the joint you’re born with?” Is there good research to buttress the contention that the new ankle implants “really mimic a natural ankle”? Is there no expert free of industry conflicts who could provide more than a few words of independent assessment of the newest ankle implants? The absence of such a source is troubling in a story about a medical device with a long history of problems. (See “Sources of Information” criterion.) The story provides good reasons to be cautious.

"Statins cut the risk of heart disease death by 28% among men, study shows",0,"This story by The Guardian highlights a new study in the journal “Circulation” that digs into the data of a 20-year study of cholesterol and heart disease in thousands of European men. The Guardian appears to lean heavily on an Imperial College press release that trumpets the benefits of taking statin drugs, which can lower LDL or “bad” cholesterol — and reduce the risk of deadly heart disease. It claims the study showed statins reduced the risk of death from heart disease by 28%. But that’s a lopsided and potentially misleading way to present the data. When broken down into absolute numbers, the benefits are far less dramatic (see quantified benefits criterion, below). In that light, the advantages compared to the disadvantages of taking statins for many years — risk of muscle pain, liver damage, diabetes, and more — become less clear. The story also misses a very big red flag when it comes to making clear that most of the authors have a financial relationship with the primary funder of the study: a drug company that makes statins. Readers need accurate data to make informed healthcare decisions. Relative numbers sound good, but are only one half of the story. Readers also deserve to know any potential conflicts of interest, such as who paid for the study."

Heart Health: New Treatments For America’s #1 Killer,0,"Is it possible that medicine can detect silent heart disease and save lives with technology as reliable, safe—and apparently cheap–as the ultrafast CT calcium test described in this broadcast? It is a problem that has stumped researchers for a very long time. The broadcast strikes several emotional chords in quick succession—the call to thwart America’s “ number one killer”; the “big headline” from a medical meeting announcing a “wake-up call” that we all “need”; the patient whose doctor said he was fine but was wrong—and the rosy dose of “minimal radiation” that just might have “saved his life”; the other patient who now has “peace of mind” because her test gave her a clean bill of health. But the broadcast has little enthusiasm for thorny details of this test, also known as electron beam CT or EBCT:    –          Evidence: The broadcast mentions none, randomized or otherwise. –          Sources: The broadcast’s scientific credibility rests on anecdotal reports of two patients and one physician-correspondent. An “n” of 2 is bad science. There is vague mention of a gathering of eminent cardiologists, but none appears. –          Harms: False-positives with this technology are legion, and hinting otherwise (“so this could be the key”) is misleading. The tests lead to additional legions of invasive and potentially harmful (and expensive) tests and procedures. False negatives are few, but they merit mention nonetheless. –          Benefits: The broadcast does not provide a quantitative estimate of potential benefits—a major omission. According to the American Heart Association, “No study has definitively demonstrated that screening with EBCT improves outcomes by reducing mortality or morbidity from [coronary artery disease].” The broadcast suggests that the test could help people with just one risk factor for heart disease. (“They need to hear about this.”) This contrasts with recommendations from the American Heart Association, which say that testing in people at low risk (or very high risk) is futile. –          Disease mongering. The broadcast teaches people to fear calcium in their arteries. Although there is good evidence showing an association between calcium scores and cardiovascular problems, the broadcast fails to point out that the test hasn’t been proven to reduce death or heart attacks. –          Treatment Options: the broadcast mentions none. The AHA statement points out that the ultrafast CT scan is “one of many contenders in a crowded field of CAD [coronary artery disease] risk-assessment tools.”"
Doctors Test Ways to Grow Knee Cartilage,2,"The article describes two potential treatments for knee problems: using stem cells donated from bone marrow to re-grow cartilage pads and using cartilage plugs, approved for use in bone, to fill in gaps in cartilage. The story does a good job of describing the evidence (either an ongoing clinical trial using stem cells to re-grow cartilage pads or the fact that cartilage plugs are an “off-label” use of an existing technology), although there are limitations to what we know or will know, which could have been clearer. For example, although the first-ever clinical trial of stem cells is ongoing, the number of participants is small and more studies will be needed before this would become widely available. The description of harms of either of these approaches could have been improved. For instance, letting a quote by the lead researcher (who has a conflict of interest) stand stating that there are no safety problems with the stem cell technique is a bit misleading. It’s hard to believe there would be no side effects at all and the fact that this is new technology and that harms may not be known is different than they don’t exist, which is implied. Yet the topic is an important one because better treatments for age-related arthritis of the knee are needed. Unfortunately, the techniques discussed in this article are only precursors of the types of treatments that may help the large number of older individuals suffering from knee arthritis. Even if these treatments provide benefit and are approved for use by the FDA, it will require future studies and many more years to bring successful treatments to the average patient."

"For pregnant women with flu, the earlier the better for antiviral treatment",1,"This news release focuses on an observational study, published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases which reports that treating pregnant women hospitalized with severe influenza in the early stages of illness with oseltamivir (sold under the brand name Tamiflu) appears to significantly reduce the patient’s time in the hospital. The study also found that pregnant women who were hospitalized with severe flu were less likely to have been vaccinated, compared to women hospitalized with milder flu. The release covers some of the bases when explaining the study and benefits, but neglected to address potential harms that were noted in the published study and to provide needed context on the absolute risk of contracting serious influenza during early pregnancy and absolute rates of risk reductions. Influenza, or “the flu,” is a widespread disease in the United States. The CDC reports that about 40 million people in the U.S. got the flu during the 2014-15 flu season, of which 970,000 required hospitalization. And the health risks associated with flu are significant for pregnant women and their unborn children. As the CDC notes: “Changes in the immune system, heart, and lungs during pregnancy make pregnant women (and women up to two weeks postpartum) more prone to severe illness from flu, as well as to hospitalizations and even death. Pregnant women with flu also have a greater chance for serious problems for their unborn baby, including premature labor and delivery.” The research findings inform treatment and preventative care of an at-risk population — pregnant women — for a widespread and dangerous disease. That deserves our attention. At the same time, we expect experts to inform us about the true nature of the risks to pregnant women and their unborn children. The safety and effectiveness of oseltamivir in treating influenza remains a controversial topic within the medical community. Following an exhaustive review of the oseltamivir clinical trials (which it had to fight for years to obtain), the Cochrane Collaboration along with the British Medical Journal (BMJ) issued a report in 2014 that strongly questioned oseltamivir’s safety and effectiveness in combating influenza. “Initially thought to reduce hospitalisations and serious complications from influenza, the review highlights that Tamiflu is not proven to do this, and it also seems to lead to harmful effects that were not fully reported in the original publications,” wrote Cochrane editor-in-chief Dr. David Tovey, “This shows the importance of ensuring that trial data are transparent and accessible.”"

Youthful fling with ‘Tommy John’ surgery,0,"This news story describes a study performed at one of the most famous sports medicine clinics in the U.S., where one of the most famous elbow surgeons in the world (and his colleagues) performs an operation known as “Tommy John” surgery (named for the Hall-Fame pitcher). The study shows that more young athletes are getting elbow reconstruction surgery at this clinic than ever before. The news story’s sole source—an author of the study—suggests that this is a widespread epidemic and speculates that the reason for the increasing number of operations in young athlete is that they are over-using their immature elbows during year-round play without any breaks. Although this may be true, the article provides no research to support this assertion. The reported increase in elbow reconstructions among young athletes may be a serious problem worthy of concern, or it may be a statistical quirk. It’s possible, for example, that this clinic is more likely than less-famous clinics to attract the parents of young athletes with a career-threatening injury. Until there is similar evidence of high surgery rates from more clinics and solid evidence that these operations are caused by over-training, this article could be raising unfounded alarm. The news story provides insufficient information in other areas as well. There is no mention of costs, potential harms, or treatment options other than surgery. And the story cites no source who is independent of the research under consideration. Interestingly, the researcher interviewed for the story assigns blame for over-training injuries to the athletes (and perhaps by implication parents and coaches). Another source might have pointed out that sports medicine physicians sometimes wonder whether they too contribute to recurrent or chronic injuries, by helping athletes to return prematurely to the sports that cause them harm."

An independent expert perspective could have helped with this. Although drugs can be effective for many patients with depression, they can cause a host of adverse effects and don’t work for everyone. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can be helpful for some patients who don’t respond to medication, but it too carries a risk of adverse effects, including confusion, memory loss, and harms related to the anesthesia.

"Cervical cancer screening can wait till 21, group says",1,"This story on revised guidelines for cervical cancer screening puts them in medical and political context. It does an adequate job of describing the new guidelines themselves. It is well sourced.

It does not give details of the evidence that the new guidelines are based on. But it falls short in broader terms. When controversial new guidelines are proposed, a reader reasonably wants to know what the guidelines are based on, how they might apply to them, and what the risks of getting the screening–or not getting it–are.

High-Precision Proton Therapy More Effective in Treating Certain Cancers When Combined with Thermal Therapy,0,"Proton beam therapy has been in vogue for the past few years due to promises to provide more precise radiation therapy, theoretically leading to fewer side effects. A news release from the University of Maryland Medical Center/School of Medicine claims that the center is the only facility in the world to offer both proton beam therapy and thermal therapy, another experimental cancer treatment, in the same facility. As we’ve discussed before, there are few definitive studies proving that proton beam therapy is more effective and safer than conventional cancer treatments. Regardless, hospitals around the country have invested massive amounts of money to be able to provide this treatment, which can lead to large bills for patients. The jury is also still out on thermal therapy, also called hyperthermia. The American Cancer Society considers hyperthermia to be an experimental treatment, and notes that it is still being reviewed in clinical trials. This news release says that these experimental treatments are highly beneficial, but provides little concrete information to back up these claims. Presenting experimental treatments as vetted therapies can be expensive for patients and blind them to possible side effects. The release also says that they are the only facility in the world that offers both treatments, but this is a vague and misleading statement. The center isn’t the only center in the U.S. that can do both therapies, much less the world. These claims may make patients feel like they have no other options if they want to pursue this treatment combination, meaning they likely won’t shop around for the best prices or medical providers. For the cancers mentioned in this release — cancers of the bladder, rectum, cervix, ovaries, pancreas, and connective tissue (sarcomas) — there are different treatment options based upon the cancer itself (its size, location, pathologic appearance, genetic markers, and spread) as well as the overall health of the patient. A wide range of treatments including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and newer treatments such as immunotherapy, are available. Because the release focuses on two newer therapies, proton beam radiation and thermal therapy, the reader may think that these are the only treatments for these conditions. Moreover, there is no information available to the reader to know which patients may benefit from such treatments. The news release is more an advertisement for a program than information that readers can use to judge how good the program may be and for whom."

(Other studies and papers, many of them conducted in Europe, gave a wider percentage range). Second, is the malnutrition so severe it caused their illness? We found nothing to support this. Third, is their malnutrition so severe it prevents them from getting better? We found research showing that malnutrition can make someone susceptible to other illnesses and contribute to longer hospitalization. But we found nothing to support  the claim that the malnutrition prevented them from recovering. Malnutrition among the elderly is clearly a serious problem.

Investigational CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib is active against a range of cancer types,2,"This release about the first set of tests in patients prescribed an experimental cancer drug, abemaciclib, uses language that mostly hews to the careful tone of the researchers’ journal article. It does not make any premature claims of cure or even extended survival. The release includes sections labeled “Limitations” and “Funding & Disclosures” that highlight these vital elements. We would have liked to see at least some discussion of the possible cost of the drug, especially since a similar drug mentioned in the release is priced around $10,000/month. The release could have explicitly noted that the new drug could fail ongoing trials, instead of using language that implies eventual success. Even with expedited status and favorable study results, it would likely be 1-3 years before this drug could be approved for routine use. People with cancer are on the lookout for any potential new treatment. Writers of news releases about experimental cancer drugs must be careful not to imply benefits that have not been proven. As this release demonstrates, even when there are no claims of cure or even extended survival, readers can come away with an inflated sense of the likely success of a drug that is only beginning to be tested in people. This study highlights a second agent in a new class of medicines that may broadly target a range of cancer types that may have similar mechanisms of action.

"Healthy aging benefits may be associated with walnut consumption, according to research",1,"This news release from the California Walnut Commission describes a study showing that a healthy diet including walnuts is associated with lower risk of impaired physical function in older women. Researchers examined data from more than 50,000 participants in the Nurses’ Health Study, a large-scale, decades-long epidemiological project funded by the National Institutes of Health, that assessed risk factors for cancer and cardiovascular disease. They found an association between a diet that included certain fruits, lettuce and walnuts and  reduced physical impairments. The news release echoes a host of previous industry declarations that walnuts “may” provide a certain health benefit that in reality could probably be obtained from a range of foods. Laudably, this news release does offer some cautions about the findings. It describes study limitations and states that researchers “emphasized that overall diet quality, rather than individual foods, may have a greater impact on reducing risk of physical function impairments.”  Physical function — defined as the ability to perform certain tasks such as climbing stairs, walking several blocks, and dressing yourself — is a key driver of mobility and independent living in older adults and a strong predictor of mortality. However, the direct role of diet in preventing the decline of physical function hasn’t been well studied. Biological research has shown that greater adherence to a healthy diet is associated with better lipid and inflammatory profiles and lower cardiovascular disease risk, which are strongly related to physical function. This study’s large sample size, long-term follow-up, and wide range of data points seem to bolster evidence of a connection between a healthy diet and prolonged quality of life."

Stem Cells and Weakened Hearts,0,"""CBS claimed an “exclusive” with this report on the “first person ever to get an infusion of his own heart stem cells” to try to avoid future problems after a heart attack. OK, they had the exclusive report that the procedure was done. But they didn’t make clear that:   There is currently nothing known about the benefits of this approach in people. That simply wasn’t emphasized in the story. Instead, it was referred to as a """"cutting edge"""" clinical trial. Are there non-cutting-edge clinical trials? It was called a """"major advance."""" It was called a """"trailblazing procedure."""" But the onscreen graphic continuously trumpeted it as a """"CBS Evening News Exclusive."""" The segment was clear that this treatment is experimental, but the failure to discuss potential risks, potential harms, costs involved, and current treatment options available to patients were huge omissions. For anyone who really wants to learn about this area of research, the National Institutes of Health has a website describing the current state of the art. It contains questions we wish the CBS segment had explored, such as (excerpt follows):   """"What are the implications for extending the research on differentiated growth of replacement tissues for damaged hearts? There are some practical aspects of producing a sufficient number of cells for clinical application. The repair of one damaged human heart would likely require millions of cells. The unique capacity for embryonic stem cells to replicate in culture may give them an advantage over adult stem cells by providing large numbers of replacement cells in tissue culture for transplantation purposes. Given the current state of the science, it is unclear how adult stem cells could be used to generate sufficient heart muscle outside the body to meet patients’ demand. Although there is much excitement because researchers now know that adult and embryonic stem cells can repair damaged heart tissue, many questions remain to be answered before clinical applications can be made. For example, how long will the replacement cells continue to function? Do the rodent research models accurately reflect human heart conditions and transplantation responses? Do these new replacement cardiomyocytes derived from stem cells have the electrical-signal-conducting capabilities of native cardiac muscle cells?"""""""

IUD Proposed to Treat Uterine Cancer,2,"This story carefully reports on these results, with appropriate caveats that emphasize the small size of the study, the preliminary nature of the results and narrow patient population (those with pre-cancerous lesions or early-stage cancer). It quotes several independent experts and  discloses potential conflict of interest. The story could have been improved by mentioning the cost of the IUD and insurance coverage. The progestin-containing IUD (brand name Mirena) is a highly effective, well-tolerated form of birth control. Pathology studies have also shown that the IUD can cause reversal of cellular changes, known as hyperplasia, in the lining of the uterus (enodmetrium) that could later lead to certain kinds of endometrial cancer.Oral progestins are an established treatment for endometrial hyperplasia and have also been used in some cases of endometrial cancer in younger women. Targeting progesterone release directly to the uterine lining through the IUD presents a potential advance in effectiveness and tolerability of treatment, while preserving fertility. The primary treatment for endometrial cancer is hysterectomy, or surgical removal of the uterus. However, for some women, particularly younger women who wish to preserve their fertility, the idea of a non-surgical alternative, is welcome news. A small study was published in this week’s Annals of Oncology followed 20 women with hyperplasia and 14 women with early-stage endometrial cancer who had a progestin-IUD implanted. Almost all (95%) of those with hyperplasia experienced reversal, while about half (57%) of those with early-stage endometrial cancer did."

Study cites new link between artery plaque and birth control pills,2,"The article does a competent job of conveying findings about a potential link between some birth control pills and arterial plaques in a small population study. The article includes necessary information about the preliminary nature of the findings and the shortcomings of the research methodology. The crucial question about this article is whether it should have been done at all. It also raises fundamental questions about journalists’ roles as gatekeepers of medical study information. The findings are riddled with caveats that raise serious questions about their value. To cite a few of the most important:  The study was done on a homogenous population of women living in one small town in Belgium. The study linked a firm clinical endpoint (ultrasound data on arterial plaques) to drug exposure that was not controlled and about which critical data–including which drug was taken, at what dose and at what age–is missing. The article does not report on whether the data was controlled for other potential confounders, including smoking, diet and underlying risk of heart disease. The study has not been submitted to the rigorous peer review required before publication in a major journal. While the article notes these caveats at least briefly, and in some cases thorougly, it does so in the context of a story that implictly raises fear about a widely used drug. For instance, the article states:  The theory needs much more rigorous testing than this single small study, but is important because of the sheer number of women now taking the pill — 100 million worldwide. It could be argued that this same reason–the fact that so many women take or have taken this drug–could disqualify this study from news coverage at this point. Is it in the public interest to report at length about such preliminary, uncertain findings about a drug that is so widely used?"

The release doesn’t say how effective the biomarkers, which like surrogate markers are representative stand-ins for actual health outcomes, were in predicting and bringing about weight loss. (Read our explainer on the downsides of surrogate markers here.) The release would have been greatly improved had it included some numbers available from the published report which explained the benefits, provided some cost considerations for this type of personalized treatment, and included information on study funders and potential conflicts of interest.

Screening MRI benefits women at average risk of breast cancer,1,"The news release does a generally good job presenting the main findings of the study. In particular, the release makes a compelling case for why current practices in breast cancer screening may be lacking, establishes the novelty of the research and presents the hypothesis that MRI screenings are helpful to women with average risk for breast cancer — and not just those at high risk. It’s a hypothesis that now needs to be confirmed. These positives are offset, however, by a few unanswered questions. First, it is unclear what average risk really means. Digging through the study’s inclusion criteria, we found that the subjects were women aged 40–70 with “a calculated lifetime breast cancer risk of 6%–12% according to the Gail model.” Those percentages are probably not what the average reader has in mind when she hears “average risk.” Second, there is no mention of the specificity (the ability of the test to correctly rule out those without the disease) of MRI screening for average risk women. Lack of specificity can lead to false positives, which have been a concern with MRI screening. Knowing only the sensitivity (the ability of the test to correctly identify people who have the disease) does not allow us to see the complete picture. This news release scored well on several of our criteria. For a discussion of another news releases on MRI screening for breast cancer that wouldn’t have scored as well, see a related post. Mammograms are known to be less effective for dense breast tissue. MRIs, though more effective in this setting, are avoided in practice for average risk patients due to higher costs. Research like this advances the discussion on the cost of breast cancer screening but it remains unclear whether MRI screening will be a cost savings down the road, especially since we don’t know how much overdiagnosis/overtreatment may be occurring with MRI screening."
"""Liquid biopsy"""" test improves health outcomes and can save over $500 million annually for the U.S. healthcare system""",0,"Many cases of prostate cancer would benefit from a wait-and-see approach, but the available diagnostic instrument, PSA testing, leads to hundreds of thousands of prostate biopsies each year and, for some 18% of those tested, complications such as infections and sexual dysfunction arise. This news release describes a recent modeling exercise of the impacts of a non-invasive urine test, SelectMDx, that is already being used to identify cancers serious enough to warrant a full biopsy. The exercise found that the test was of modest value to individual patients, leading on average to fewer than 20 additional healthy days, but could lead to significant societal cost savings over the course of a year for more than 300,000 patients by reducing the number of cases that move on to a full biopsy. Prostate cancer was the leading solid tumor and second leading cause of death from cancer in American males in 2017. Paradoxically, it also can simmer at a low ebb without medical intervention or harm for many men. Figuring out whose cancer can be left alone and whose deserve a full-on attack has proved challenging, making the development of non-invasive screening tests important. SelectMDx is one of several such tests. All screening tests are non-invasive, the issue is that PSA is elevated not only in men without cancers but in men with low-risk cancers. Making biopsy decisions based on PSA alone leads to unnecessary biopsies in men without cancer and often to unnecessary treatment in men with a low-risk cancer who undergo active treatment."

First-in-Canada Implant of Novel Sensor Device for Heart Failure Patients,0,"This news release covers the first implantation of a device called CardioMEMS in a Canadian heart failure patient. The wireless device includes a butterfly-like sensor, which sits inside the patient’s pulmonary artery and sends pressure readings to a secure website. No other context or data are given. Although CardioMEMS is “novel” in Canada, the US has implanted the device in patients since 2007, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it for market in 2014. We would have liked to have seen some outcome data from the CHAMPION trial, which followed 550 heart failure patients for around 15 months to see whether patients with CardioMEMS devices would require fewer heart failure-related hospitalizations. Instead, we are told that this one Canadian patient’s implantation procedure in March was “successful,” without any further information on how the patient is doing now and may do in the future. Finally, the news release uses terms like “big game-changer” for the device and refers to heart failure as an “epidemic.” In these types of announcements, we like to see more neutral and cautious wording for medical stories, especially since the news release doesn’t mention the costs and harms associated with this device. Invasive procedures and surgery should be used as last resorts, after all other interventions — such as lifestyle changes and medications — have failed. The list of potential adverse effects associated with the implantation procedure is long, and patients should think long and hard and understand the risks before undergoing such treatments. Although many media outlets like medical technology stories, news releases also have the responsibility to caution reporters and patients on the device’s harms, as well as any relevant data and information from clinical trials. The results (outlined in the benefits section) of the CHAMPION trial were clear, but it’s also important to note that all authors had some kind of financial interest or tie to CardioMEMS, as seen by the disclosures statement in the original journal article."
APP HELPS SAVE SEATTLE CARDIAC PATIENT,2,"This is a story about the use of an app called PulsePoint in the care of a Seattle victim of sudden cardiac arrest. In the process of telling a patient story that ended well, the reader is provided with information on the app’s development, its current use across the country and how the reader can become involved in what can best be described as the crowdsourcing of out-of-hospital care for victims of cardiac arrest. While certainly an intriguing use of technology that merits news discussion, the story left us with questions: What research was conducted to show this app is beneficial? And how solid was that research? What are the potential harms or downsides of using an app in this way? How typical was the patient’s story? An American Heart Association report released in 2015 noted that there are approximately 326,000 cases of out-of hospital-cardiac arrests in the United States. The survival rate with good neurologic function is approximately 8%. Importantly, just about one-third of the victims survive when cardiac arrest is witnessed. An app that advises people nearby of an event, especially those who are trained in CPR, is likely to save additional lives–but how do we know for sure? And are the potential harms worth it? The story should have explained how proof is being collected, if at all."

Study: New device boosts heart failure survival,1,"Overall, this story does a good job of reporting that a continuous-flow heart assist device performed better than an older, pulsatile-flow model in selected patients with advanced heart disease who were not considered candidates for heart transplants. It highlights the cost as well as the potential benefits of the device. It clearly points out that the manufacturer of the device sponsored the study and that many of the researchers consult for it or other device makers. However, the story may give readers an exaggerated sense of the value of this device by saying it could help “many older people with severe heart failure” without clearly describing the narrowly defined group of patients that was included in this trial. What’s more, although more than half of the patients who received the new device either died, suffered a stroke or had to have surgery to fix a failed device, the story quotes only patients who reported glowingly positive experiences. The story also appears to have confused survival rates with the combined endpoint of survival without either a stroke or device failure. The story says that four times as many patients survived for two years with the new device; but the study reports that the two-year survival rates were 58 percent and 24 percent – more than doubling survival, not quadrupling it."

Football boosts bone development in boys,0,"The news release reports on a British study comparing bone development in 12- to 14-year-old boys who played football (or soccer, as it’s known in the United States) to those involved in competitive cycling or swimming and to active boys who did not regularly play sports. The release touts the bone-building benefits of playing football but omits that the study on which it reports identified almost no significant difference in bone development measures between highly competitive soccer players and boys who were active but not involved in sports. It also left out any discussion of the risks or the financial costs associated with playing soccer competitively. Bone development during childhood and adolescence has lifelong implications for health. Poor bone development during youth increases adults’ risk for osteoporosis and fractures, which can lead to other negative health outcomes. The news release also is important because soccer is the most popular sport in the world. In 2014, more than 3 million youth (boys and girls, ages 5-19) were members of the U.S. Youth Soccer organization, which claims to include 85 percent of all registered youth soccer players in the United States. However, the rate of youth soccer injuries also has increased, more than doubling between 1990 and 2014. It’s important to note that the release (or the study on which it’s based) does not offer any guidance to the families of the vast majority of children who are more casual athletes, nor does it mention what role weight-bearing sports might play on girls’ bone development. At this point, the conclusions could be useful to researchers continuing to study exercise and bone health, but readers should approach these conclusions with caution."

"Lithium should be more widely used for bipolar disorder, researchers say",2,"This story is about a study on the frequency of different side effects of four drugs used in the treatment of bipolar disorders. The researchers conclude that lithium should be used more widely, given its lower rate of side effects. The story notes that lithium is documented by other studies to lower the risk of suicide, something that few treatments do in people with bipolar disorders–and a significant advantage given the substantial suicide risk in this group. It also notes that some of the drug’s bad reputation likely stemmed from the higher doses used in decades past and subsequent more side effects. All in all, the story hit many of the important points in explaining the findings, though we wanted to see some discussion on the limitations of this kind of research, as well as costs of the drugs. Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depressive disorder, is relatively common with a lifetime prevalence of about 3% in general population. Understanding the side effect profile of the drugs used to treat this disease, along with their relative effectiveness in reducing the burden of disease, are both essential in identifying the best treatment options for people. Unfortunately, comparative effectiveness studies are uncommon, but those that have been done have shown that the newer drugs are not better than lithium in terms of effectiveness. This study adds the important finding that lithium’s side effects are also not as burdensome as thought. It’s vital that this new information is conveyed accurately to the public."
Women who eat lots of fiber have less breast cancer,2,It’s not often you see a story that so simply explains possible confounders in research.

"Genetic tests for psychiatric drugs spur hope, doubts",2,"This story, originally reported by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting and published in partnership with the Boston Globe, describes the history and ethical implications of a loophole allowing genetic tests to bypass FDA approval before doctors prescribe them. Specifically, it outlines concerns regarding the use of genetic testing to help psychiatrists identify which drugs may work best for a patient with mental illness. The story evaluates the research that genetic testing companies use to demonstrate the effectiveness of their tests — and reports that most of these studies are funded or conducted by the companies themselves. The story makes clear that using these genetic tests to guide decisions on prescribing drugs poses risks for patients. The article overall is very well-researched and covers an emerging and important topic. According to the CDC, approximately 25 percent of U.S. adults have some form of mental illness. Finding the right drug and dose for treating a mental illness can be time-consuming — and mentally, physically and emotionally exhausting for both patients and their loved ones. As a result, the idea of using a genetic test to identify drug treatments that are most likely to be effective is incredibly appealing for all concerned. However, it’s important to recognize the limitations of the current research supporting such testing. The tests are costly and may not offer any benefit. The tests may slightly help doctors pick the right drug more quickly, or they may not, but the drugs that are picked after the genetic tests are done are subject to the same scrutiny as always."

Scientists Testing Vaccines to Help Smokers Quit,1,"This story announces that NicVax (Nicotine Conjugate Vaccine) has been fast-tracked for approval by the FDA. This story clearly describes the current stage in the drug-approval process: The company must conclude several trials before even applying for final FDA approval. However, the storyâ€™s enthusiasm for the vaccine at this stage of clinical trails seems to suggest FDA approval is a fait accompli. This article contains a clear and excellent sketch of how a vaccine might stimulate production of antibodies to dampen specific drug-induced effects of nicotine on the brain, thus reducing the pleasure associated with smoking. We are told that “researchers report high rates of quitting in early studies”, yet the story provides no evidence on the efficacy or safety of the vaccine from these studies. It is not enough to say that there is excitement about the vaccine’s approach. Some data are needed to judge whether excitement is warranted. Other drugs approved as smoking cession aids such as bupropion (Wellbutrin) and varenicline (Chantix) are mentioned, as are nicotine replacement products such as patches or gum. The story suggests that NicVax may be used in conjunction with these products, yet this has not been tested in clinical trials thus far. Behavioral therapies, of proven benefit and a component of Chantix and Wellbutrin trials, are not mentioned. The story does not provide the cost of the vaccine, yet there is the suggestion that if it were approved, the vaccine could be a financial boon for Nabi Biopharmaceuticals. Only sources affiliated with the study and Nabi Biopharmaceuticals are cited. The National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) funded early phases of the study with a $4.1 million grant so the director of NIDA pharmacotherapies has an interest in the outcome of the trials.

New prenatal tests provide clearer answers sooner,2,"This story discusses first trimester screening for prenatal chromosomal abnormalities, namely Down syndrome. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) looked at sequential screening of women 10-13 weeks into their pregnancy, instead of the typical 16 week screening. Combining blood tests and ultrasound screening succeeded in finding 87% of Down fetuses (though a positive test is still only a prediction of increased risk that a baby will be born with Down syndrome). The journalist did not mention the false positive rate of the 1st trimester vs. 2nd trimester screenings in the NEJM study, nor the study design. However, a discussion of what constitutes a “positive” result of screening was a plus for this story. The story also was balanced in presenting the risks of screening and the risk of miscarriage due to subsequent diagnostic tests, such as chorionic villus sampling or CVS (sampling cells via a thin tube or needle inserted into the placenta) and amniocentesis.

Stem Cells Shows Promise For Repairing Torn Meniscus,0,"This news release describes the results of an experiment using stem cells and other blood components derived from fat tissue to repair a torn meniscus. The release relies on general statements regarding the degree of benefits or harms to the patient and ignores the issue of costs entirely. It doesn’t adequately explain the research. It suggests that the approach described is readily available, although it is not. Both the release and the published report are based on a single patient case, not a clinical trial (or even a case series). As such, the data supporting the release are very limited. Injuries to the meniscus are common among Americans and the routine approach to fixing them involves surgery. If a new method could avoid an invasive approach, that would be a boon to public health. But this new approach requires sophisticated cellular separation techniques which are not cheap. And touting the results of one experiment on a single patient followed for barely a year is clearly premature."
Clinical studies show 'CHORI-bar' results in broad scale health improvements: Benefits apparent after 2 months of consumption of the nutrient bar,0,"Researchers at Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI; recently renamed UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital) announce the development of a “micronutrient and fiber-dense supplement bar” that apparently led to improved metabolism and weight loss in overweight and obese individuals in clinical trials. But a supplement bar that prompts weight loss would be an extraordinary development (assuming it contains no amphetamines), and so we’d need some accordingly robust evidence to back up such claims. Unfortunately, this news release isn’t up to the task. Though it cites “broad scale health improvements” in the headline, the release offers no data that would substantiate a beneficial effect to consumers of the “CHORI bar.” It provides only vague, advertising-like claims such as this one: “The full potential of food-based supplements to do the work of some drugs without their negative side effects is just beginning to be seriously investigated.”   Who would not jump at the chance to consume something as simple-sounding as a nutrient bar that leads to weight loss? If the CHORI bar is the real thing, it will be a boon to individuals seeking to lose weight, as well as to the coffers of its developers and manufacturers. Given that it is still in clinical trials and that scientists have yet to discover the constituents of the bar that work this magic on our metabolism, however, the CHORI bar deserves a muted response from journalists and the public."

HPV testing is better than the Pap test at detecting cervical cancer,2,"In a 12-year study of more than a million women in the Kaiser Permanente of Northern California system, researchers concluded that the HPV screening test alone may be enough to detect the vast majority of cancers and so-called “pre-cancers” without the added second test known as the Pap test. In the study, women received both tests. The study examined patients who had cancer or pre-cancer to determine whether their disease would have been missed by HPV testing alone. The release states: “Given the rarity of cancers among screened women, the contribution of the Pap test to screening translated to earlier detection of at most five cases per million women per year.” This study concludes that double-testing or co-testing is only protecting a tiny minority of patients, and that a single HPV test may be enough. Even though economics is part of the reason for the study,  the release does not tell us how much money might be saved if a single test became the standard of care. Prevention by early detection is a key part of saving lives from cervical cancer. The Pap smear has been widely used in the United States since the 1950s. As a result, the incidence of cervical cancer has dramatically decreased. However, the fact that certain strains of human papilloma virus (HPV) caused almost all cervical cancer was not discovered until decades later. With the introduction of testing for HPV starting after 2000, the role for the Pap and HPV test has been evolving. This study addresses the question of whether it is time to abandon the original Pap test in favor of just using the HPV test — or whether both are better than either alone. The answer seems to be that the Pap smear’s days are numbered."

Training children’s bodies to overcome food allergies? Study says it’s possible,2,"""Allergies to common food stuffs, that elicit severe reaction can be life threatening and are a serious problem. This story presented some very preliminary results that suggest a means of making these situations more manageable for the affected individual. The story, while generally fairly complete in its description of the research, was a bit imbalanced in its assessment of the effectiveness and applicability of the treatment described. Letting the lead researcher get away with saying that there would be a treatment for kids with food allergy in 5 years is complete conjecture and may offer false hope for a timetable. From the results available at this time, it is not clear whether this treatment will be beneficial to individuals older than pre-school, whether its effectiveness might diminish over time or whether there are some undesireable side effects that might accompany this treatment. The story did provide ample caveats about the small, pilot nature of the studies and the fact that larger, randomized studies were needed to improve the evidence. But including the prediction from the lead researcher and the quote from the parent of a child in the study –  """"Our whole worry level is really gone."""" – introduces an imbalance that is not backed up by evidence at this time. This is very preliminary research, done in small numbers of children. That should be an important take-home message for consumers."""
New osteoporosis treatment uses traditional Chinese herb to prevent bone loss,0,"This news release describes research showing that a chemical compound in the red sage plant blocks an enzyme that promotes the breakdown of collagen in bones. This might be an interesting lead for scientists, but the release prematurely dubs the plant a “treatment” for osteoporosis and doesn’t mention that effects observed in cells in a lab dish or in mice might not translate to a benefit for human patients. The result people care about — reducing fractures — isn’t brought up. The news release’s assertion that this herb “might hold the key to a new osteoporosis therapy that could prevent bone loss without causing side effects” might raise false hopes. The use of red sage to treat osteoporosis in traditional Chinese medicine has inspired researchers. A 2014 review found 36 clinical trials using the plant, also called danshen or salvia miltiorrhiza, which it says constituted “more than 30 percent of all herbal clinical trials successfully targeting osteoporosis.” Osteoporosis is common, affecting 5.1 percent of men and 24.5 percent of women over the age of 65, according to the CDC. The condition increases the risk of bone fractures, which can lead to pain and disability. But isolating a plant compound and testing it in the lab are preliminary steps, and there’s no guarantee that red sage can safely prevent bone fractures. News releases should refrain from predicting outcomes for human beings based on studies in lab dishes and mice."
Text messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit,1,"Editor’s note: On the day this  review was published, the news release it’s based on was removed from the EurekAlert! site. We have saved the original news release as a pdf. Using mobile devices to inform, persuade and ultimately change health behaviors is all the rage. A recent meta-analysis suggests that these efforts can be effective when it comes to convincing pregnant smokers to cut back, although it also finds that persuading smokers to stop is less successful. This news release describes a study that used an experimental design (randomized intervention and control groups) to explore whether text messages would be effective in helping pregnant women to stop smoking. Those messages did not produce any statistically significant reduction in smoking cessation rates, as the study itself makes clear. So it’s concerning to see this news release headlined: “Text messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.” A more accurate headline would have been: “Text messaging program not shown to help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.” The researchers did find a possible benefit in older mothers-to-be and in individuals further along in their pregnancies. However, finding from such smaller subgroups are considered “hypothesis-generating,” meaning they can point to trends that merit further study. They cannot provide conclusive evidence that a treatment provides a health benefit. You can read more about subgroups and their limitations here. The bottom line here seems to be that the messages were not very influential, although the news release portrays the effort as a success story. And that misleading framing has already been carried through to some news stories about the study. Other journalists looking into the study should tread carefully. Mothers-to-be smoking while pregnant poses health harms for fetuses and early childhood, yet a reported 10 percent of pregnant women continue to smoke. Figuring out ways to persuade them to stop has merit."

Plus, a drop in a price index doesn’t always translate into a lower price for the customer. Most analysts judge health care costs not by prices but overall spending. By that measure, costs continue to rise, albeit slowly. The impact of the Affordable Care Act on containing the cost of health care remains largely unproven. Schultz had some accurate numbers on prices but he was too quick to treat those as changes in costs and the role of the Affordable Care Act is sketchy for the time being."

"Health Buzz: Dried Plums May Reduce Colon Cancer Risk The sweet snack can affect gut bacteria, researchers say.",0,"Yet another miracle food to add to the list. This story excites the reader at the prospect of eating dried plums to reduce the risk of colon cancer. In a study on rats, researchers from Texas A&M University found that a diet consisting of dried plums promotes beneficial bacteria in the colon and reduces the development of precancerous lesions. But does a reduction in such lesions (not actual cancers) in a rat mean that a human eating more plums would have less risk of developing cancer? The story eagerly suggests that “people who eat dried plums as part of a regular diet can reduce their risk for developing colon cancer.” But we think that statement is totally inappropriate based on this animal study. In fact, human readers would be “plum” crazy to change their diet based on this research. According to the National Cancer Institute, colon cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, and approximately $13.8 billion is spent annually on providing colon cancer care. Colon cancer prevention is a top priority, but when risk factors include age, obesity, alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity, dried plums may not be the most appropriate intervention."

International trial changing standard of care for advanced breast cancer,1,"A study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) scientific conference that supposedly will “change the standard of care” for patients with advanced breast cancer should have more evidence backing up the claim. This news release gives short shrift to salient details, including costs, risks, the quality of the evidence, and proof of the novelty of this surgery-first approach. The release doesn’t  acknowledge that the study found no difference between groups for the primary outcome (survival at 36 months). A statistical difference was found when the study was extended to 40 months but on a smaller subset of the original full sample group. The release makes the results sound like a success by focusing on subgroups of patients, but those results should be interpreted very carefully. Although the news release was able to discuss in simple terms some of the results of the study, there is concern when broad statements such as claims of a change in practice will occur based on the results of one study. There were also some study limitations that were not addressed in the news release. The original study was powered to detect differences in survival between the two groups at 36 months, but the study failed to find a difference. It was only with subgroup analyses and a longer follow-up time did the researchers find significant differences between the groups. The concern is that the study may not have been adequately powered for these subgroup analyses and therefore, the results may not be accurate."

Cancer Drug Keytruda Keeps Some Patients Alive For 3 Years,2,"Former president Jimmy Carter announced in August 2015 that he had melanoma skin cancer that spread to his liver and brain. Months later, he shocked the world again by releasing a statement teasing he was in remission. He said a bit more before a videotaped Sunday school class he led, noting an immunotherapy drug called pembrolizumab — known better as Keytruda — was part of his treatment alongside surgery and radiation. (See our previous coverage: What the media got wrong about Jimmy Carter’s cancer cure.) NBC News has followed the story since it broke last summer, and the outlet revisited it again on the coattails of a new study on Keytruda, published April 19, 2016 in JAMA. NBC News’ latest story was also accompanied by a 2-minute video. The stories together do a nice job of walking readers through the study’s numbers, how pembrolizumab might work, the side effects, costs, and other details. It also cites several researchers who weren’t involved with the study and addresses a key issue with hype by stating the study’s finding “doesn’t mean a cure.” This vivid picture of success may set readers up for false expectations of benefit. Because as the story itself points out, a majority of patients treated with the drug didn’t live longer than three years. Melanoma is an increasingly common form of cancer, likely due to the rise of tanning’s popularity and other risk factors. But it’s also the most lethal form of skin cancer, according to the American Cancer Society, killing more than 10,000 of 76,000 people diagnosed each year in the United States. A new drug that improves life span is certainly a welcome idea."
Drug may work in melanoma tumors in brain,0,"This story offers tantalizing hints of potential benefits of an experimental drug for melanoma, ipilimumab, but without any substance that would allow readers to judge the merits of the claims. It relies on readers to know that medical meeting presentations do not go through the sort of peer review required by leading journals. It expects readers to know what a “phase II” trial is and what sort of limitations that fact implies about the value (or lack thereof) of the study conclusions. The story fails to provide context or interpretation. Indeed, the reporter did not include any comments from anyone; the story is essentially a summary of a summary. The story highlights a trial that is claimed to be a “first;” specifically the “first to test ipilimumab in patients whose skin cancer had spread to the brain.” How significant is that step? Other than saying that brain tumors are difficult to treat, the story doesn’t explain what is newsworthy about this trial. A more serious failure is lack of disclosure that the trials and researchers received funding from companies developing the experimental drug. The story also appears to misstate the design of the second trial that it mentions. Medical meeting abstracts lack context and key information on methods, patients and study limitations. Stories based on these abstracts suffer the same inadequacies."

Flash: No Needles.

It clearly describes the problem, the study, and its results. The writer provides useful context for understanding the scope of the problem and why researchers are interested in finding alternatives to the most commonly used hot flash treatment, hormone therapy. By providing detail about how the study was done and by explaining that hot flashes often get better even with inactive (or placebo) treatments, the story helps readers understand the finding that acupuncture was no better than a sham treatment. Many women reportedly use some type of complementary or alternative therapy to try to control hot flashes. This article wraps these new data about acupuncture neatly around a well-written story about why some of them might get relief and others not. Given the story’s overall quality, the lack of information on costs is a relatively minor flaw."

More than 103 million Americans will have high blood pressure under new guidelines,1,"This story about new guidelines from the American Heart Association and other medical groups that reduce the threshold for diagnosis of high blood pressure summarizes the key recommendations, but doesn’t explain benefits, harms or costs. This story (along with those from many other news media outlets) should have addressed the glaring disconnect between what is recommended and what doctors and patients actually do. The story used far lower estimates of the number of people likely to be told to start taking drugs than what was contained in an American Heart Association news release. (And the online and video versions of the ABC News stories used very different numbers.) Readers of this story learn that they are more likely to be told they have high blood pressure, but not what that means to them, other than that they will probably hear more lectures about diet and exercise, and maybe get more drug prescriptions. For a good alternative view, see the this New York Times opinion piece. If almost all of the “new” patients with high blood pressure will be simply advised to improve their lifestyle, by doing things like exercising more, eating better and drinking less alcohol, which are things everyone is advised to do, then what has really changed? Any time that medical experts spout the routine lifestyle advice, reporters should press them to explain what is really likely to change for patients. Will physicians and clinics adopt (and will insurers pay for) more effective lifestyle interventions? Or will it be business as usual for most patients, except that more people will be prescribed drugs?"

Computers help docs spot breast cancer on X-rays,2,"This well-reported story on a study of computer-aided detection (CAD) of problems found in mammograms follows most health journalism best practices. But two related flaws, and one contextual issue, prevent it from providing a higher level of reader service. As the ratings above show, the reporter provides necessary information about evidence and outcomes, and does an excellent job with sourcing. It communicates very clearly the conclusion that one radiologist using CAD appears to be as effective in identifying cancers as two radiologists reading the same images. The flaw is that the story fails to compare the benefit of these practices to the most common method of diagnosis used in the U.S.–a single reading by one radiologist. The published study itself reveals that double readings have been shown to be 4 to 14 percent more effective at detection than single readings, with a meta-analysis showing a 10 percent advantage. Combined with the report’s failure to directly compare costs of single-reader, double-reader and single-reader-with-CAD methods, the reader isn’t able to understand the real trade-offs facing the U.S. medical system: the cost of missed cancers vs. the cost of additional technology. And finally, when dealing with mammography it’s important for reporters to understand the underlying challenge is not simply to identify cancers, but to identify the cancers that matter. It has not been demonstrated that diagnosing more cases of breast cancer reduces mortality or incidence of invasive cancers. This fact is always worth mentioning in stories about the benefits of cancer detection."

Adamas Pharma secures approval for Parkinson's dyskinesia drug,0,"One of the main drugs used to treat Parkinson’s disease, levodopa, frequently causes a disabling side effect known as dyskinesia. Drugmakers of a newly approved drug, Gocovri, claim their medication can ease this side effect. For patients, Gocrovi may be a welcome addition. But there are a number of important unanswered questions that this story doesn’t answer. Notably, that this drug is essentially the same medication as amantadine, which has been used off label for this condition for years. Will Gocovri really be an improvement, or just an expensive version of amantadine? Since the basic ingredient in Gocovri, the antiviral drug amantadine, has been on the market for decades, one wonders what kind of medical advance this approval represents. Some independent perspective was needed in this story to help readers–including investors who read business news like this–make sense of the claims."

Experimental drug shows promise for quick treatment of postpartum depression,2,"This is story about a small, early test of a new type of drug to treat postpartum depression. The story is careful to note the preliminary nature of the findings and that the only source is company statements, since the study report has not been submitted for peer-review. However, it is hard to see the health news in a tiny phase 2 study, especially when no independent sources are included in the story to help provide balance to the claims. As readers, we’re also left wondering about potential harms specific to pregnant and new mothers, such as the drug’s ability to affect a baby in utero or pass through breastmilk. (Editor’s note: STAT has updated the story since this review was posted, and the “Read Original Story” link above will take you to the updated version, not the original version that we saw. Some of these changes address several of the Not Satisfactory ratings below. However, our ratings still stand: While updates are great, they aren’t likely to be seen by people who read the original story.) This story reports some positive early hints about an experimental drug tested in a few women with the symptoms of major depression. But with phrases like “paradigm shift,” readers could easily get the impression that the results are far more reliable, and relevant to many more women, than is justified based on the company announcement. And STAT was far from the only news outlet writing about the study in such a way. It got a lot of play in the financial press and in investor circles, helping boost the company’s stock price, with the price closing up 37%. But whether the source is STAT or a more financial-minded publication, all stories posted online have the potential to reach and influence readers who are searching for health news. That’s why all such stories with health claims should scrutinize medical evidence."
Good long-term improvement after 'reverse' shoulder replacement in patients under 60,1,"This release explains the results of a very small retrospective study that looked at the long-term results of reverse shoulder replacement (RSA) surgery in adults under 60 years old. Previous studies had suggested that such surgeries weren’t recommended for younger adults, but this release claims the new study shows that they are. It provides numerical data showing improvement among study participants, although much of that is subjective and points out the negative outcomes from the study. It makes no mention of the cost of such procedures, which can range from $7,000 to more than $20,000. It also omits who funded the study and doesn’t state that the corresponding author has received payment from replacement joint manufacturers. Shoulder injuries among adults, especially the elderly, can severely affect their quality of life and ability to participate in some activities. In general, those adults who remain active tend to be in better health so any procedures that may support that active lifestyle should be encouraged, assuming these results are borne out in subsequent larger studies. Rotator cuff pathology will eventually affect almost everyone, but a very small percentage of people will develop unrepairable massive tears and have severe pain. The problem is especially unusual in the younger population, because the tears are related to degenerative tissue failing which usually occurs in an older population. In addition, progression to massive unrepairable tears occurs over time. RSA is a viable option in the over 60 group only when other soft tissue repairs to help stabilize the shoulder and resolve pain are not possible due to the nature of the residual rotator cuff tissue."
Zinc May Prevent and Shorten Colds,0,"A review of studies about zinc’s benefits for preventing and treating the common cold was handled in slightly different — but important — ways by three outlets: WebMD, the New York Times and Reuters Health. WebMD hit fewer of our marks because it did not make cost information clear, muddied the waters in its analysis of the evidence and failed to quantify the benefits of zinc in a transparent way. We think it did a nice job explaining the science behind zinc’s effect on colds, and it provided some good details about the possible harms associated with taking zinc. But Reuters took a much more cautious approach – and appropriately so – with a headline that “Zinc will help your cold, at least a little”. And the opening sentences:  “may take the edge off the common cold. But not a whole lot.”  The search for a cure for the common cold is a quest almost as old as medicine, and the researchers involved in this review and in the underlying studies being reviewed were understandably excited about the possibility that zinc might actually prevent colds and cut down on their duration. But, as this story notes at the end, there is still work to be done to determine the right dose and the proper application of zinc to get the most benefit. Stories like this can have the unintended effect of sending droves of people to the drug store to start taking zinc as a daily supplement, even when the jury is still out."
Light therapy effectively treats early prostate cancer,0,"This news release reports the results of a phase 3 trial of a cancer treatment called vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP), which involves injecting a light-sensitive drug into the bloodstream and then activating it with a laser to destroy tumor tissue. Researchers in Europe randomized 413 men with low-risk prostate cancer, assigning half to VTP and half to the current standard of care, active surveillance, and tracked their progress over 24 months. The news release reports quantified benefits and harms and mentions that the research was funded by a company that holds a commercial license for the therapy. However, it does not state the full extent of harms, offers no discussion of study limitations, and hypes the findings with speculative quotes, a faulty comparison with breast cancer treatment, and a patient anecdote that includes scary language. This poorly done news release was also rehashed nearly verbatim by Reuters. We also reviewed that story, which earned one star. Medical practice is evolving away from treating low-risk prostate cancer, in which the cancer is small and expected to grow very slowly. The current standard of care is active surveillance, in which no treatment is given and periodic tests are performed to see if the cancer is growing. For most men, treatment is never required or can be postponed for years without lowering the chance of a cure. Researchers in this study argue VTP is a “safe, effective treatment for low-risk, localized prostate cancer” and “might allow more men to consider a tissue-preserving approach and defer or avoid radical therapy” on the off chance that their cancer were to grow and require more invasive measures. But in an accompanying editorial, Stephen Freedland, M.D., of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, argues it’s “not readily apparent” who might benefit from VTP, which he says amounts to over-treatment for patients with low-risk disease and under-treatment for patients with aggressive cancers. A larger question is, are the financial costs and potential adverse effects of this therapy worth a marginal short-term improvement for patients who have a low risk? Any discussion of the merits of this potential treatment must address that uncertainty. While VTP apparently was derived from bacteria that thrive with little sunlight, that’s a property not shared by science."

Postmenopausal hormone therapy exceeding ten years may protect from dementia,0,"When the news release launches with a discussion of two huge studies and saying that the “largest study comprised approximately 230,000 Finnish women and the follow-up time in different studies was up to 20 years” you think you are going to hear some stunning findings with ample evidence to back them up. Instead, this release about the possible benefits of hormone therapy as a way to prevent Alzheimer’s is very light on actual information. It provides some cautionary notes in a few spots, but it also obscures some key facts from the same studies it touts. It’s true that Alzheimer’s disease disproportionately affects more women than men and research into why is an important public health question. But as presented, even with caveats, this release might encourage women to embark on long-term hormone therapy with no evidence showing it prevents Alzheimer’s disease. On the other hand, many large studies have shown that hormone therapy does carry many serious health risks."

"""Dan Patrick Says Texas tax legislation would """"save the average homeowner in Texas $20,000 a year over the next 20 years or so.""",0,"Patrick said legislation targeting local tax rate growth will result in the average Texas homeowner saving $20,000 a year over 20 years. That’s an absurd amount. Even if we look at what Patrick purportedly meant to say — $20,000 over 20 years — we find major flaws in the assumptions underlying that calculation. To reach that amount, one must assume that every city, county and special taxing district will raise tax rates by 8 percent every year without this legislation in place and by 5 percent a year with it. Neither assumption is in line with recent history, making the total savings figure highly suspect, at best a wild guess. The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

An NBC Reporter Investigates His Own Cancer,0,"This was a story about NBC reporter George Lewis’ diagnosis and treatment for prostate cancer. First we want to extend our best wishes to Mr. Lewis for successful treatment and for good health. But the principles of sound journalism are not suspended just because a reporter is reporting on his own illness. This story violated almost all of those principles. The story did not:  discuss the costs of the proton beam therapy which the reporter chose to pursue. The costs are a major issue – $50,000 or more per patient. discuss questions about the evidence of benefit from proton beam therapy. include any interviews with cancer experts. The most serious flaw, though, was that the reporter abandoned journalism ethics and advocated prostate cancer screening. He said: “Every guy over 50, doctors say sometimes every guy over 45, should get tested annually for prostate cancer. There’s a simple blood test called a PSA and a digital rectal exam where the doctor feels for lumps in the prostate. Early detection is the key.” That is not an evidence-based recommendation. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force states: The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening for prostate cancer using prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing or digital rectal examination (DRE). Although the Task Force found evidence that screening can find prostate cancer early and that some cancers benefit from treatment, the Task Force is uncertain whether the potential benefits of prostate cancer screening justify the potential harms. The potential harms of prostate cancer screening include fairly frequent false-positive results from PSA screening, which may lead to unnecessary anxiety and biopsies. In addition, early detection and treatment may result in complications from treating some cancers that may never have affected a patient’s health. NBC Nightly News has done something similar to this before – when reporter Mike Taibbi advocated lung cancer screening after he was scanned in a story. We have commented on such news stories in the past. They violate the Society of Professional Journalists’ code of ethics  which states that journalists should “distinguish between advocacy and news reporting. Analysis and commentary should be labeled and not misrepresent fact or context.”"

Amgen Announces Repatha® (Evolocumab) Significantly Reduced The Risk Of Cardiovascular Events In FOURIER Outcomes Study,1,"This release reports on a large clinical trial that studied the use of the drug Repatha in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Or, more accurately, it reports that the details of the results of that study will be revealed at a major scientific meeting more than a month from now. While the release does mention the potential harms of the drug, it fails to provide any real data on the benefits of the drug, nor does it mention that the drug is very expensive, with a list price of $14,100 annually. It contains no statements or information from researchers involved in the study. Our review of a related Reuters story suggests that Amgen’s efforts met with some success. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is a serious, often fatal condition worldwide and new drugs that could treat it effectively would be a welcome improvement in clinical care. But this release is troubling in that it’s touting results to be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting, more than a month in the future, and it provides little, if any, substantive information for readers. It’s unusual to announce results and not include a source or a link to the results. When we contacted Amgen for copies of the study abstracts named in the release, the company declined, instead referring us to the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the sponsors of the upcoming meeting. The ACC informed us that the abstract for the  FOURIER study is under embargo until the presentation time on March 17. It’s not unusual for sponsors of scientific meetings to have a strict media embargo on scientific study presentations. This early release strikes us as an effort to frame the discussion about the drug’s benefits in the trial without providing the required background needed for assessment."

"Prostate cancer being overtreated, study shows",2,"The story describes a study which quantifies the number of men who might be overtreated with surgery or radiation for prostate cancer. The story does a nice job of describing the natural history of prostate cancer, that is, that many prostate cancers are slow-growing and that many men don’t need treatment, which can have troublesome side effects. The article could have been more clear about the study design and exactly how many men were estimated to have been “overtreated.” Viewers are provided information about how many men were candidates for watchful waiting and could easily assume that any man who did not choose this approach was overtreated. Yet the actual study reports 10% of men were “overtreated.” The story also strangely reports an anecdotal story of one man who presumably chose watchful waiting. Yet this man also took a course of hormone therapy, which has multiple bothersome side effects related to depletion of nearly all a man’s testosterone (side effects like loss of sex drive). It’s confusing why this example was chosen, when this isn’t normally considered an option for men with low-risk prostate cancer."

‘Super X-rays’ show promise for finding heart disease but produce high radiation dose,2,"""The concept of cardiac CT sounds like a great one: to be able to get high resolution images of the coronary arteries in a non-invasive way. One potential use of the scans would be to identify those without blockages to save them from getting the more invasive angiography procedure. Unfortunately, cardiac CT scans are being performed on those without symptoms or suspicion of heart disease, and in the absence of evidence to support its use in this population, the harms of the test (including radiation exposure) may not be worth its benefits. According to the 2006 American Heart Association Guidelines, """"For CT angiography, the higher radiation doses suggest the need for greater forethought when using these tests, and use of these higher radiation exposure tests in asymptomatic persons for screening purposes is not currently recommended."""" In particular, """"Use of CT angiography in asymptomatic persons as a screening test for atherosclerosis (noncalcific plaque) is not recommended"""". This story reports on a recent presentation of the results of a study comparing cardiac CT to angiography in high-risk individuals. The story accurately represents the availability, novelty, and costs of the scan. The story quotes multiple independent experts who provide valuable commentary on the implications of the new findings. By not exaggerating the seriousness or prevalence of heart disease, the story avoids disease mongering. However, the story could have been more clear about who the CT scans are intended for. The study in question was in those with suspected heart disease, not the assymptomatic or """"worried well"""". The use of CT scans in the larger asymptomatic population is controversial. The story correctly describes radiation exposure as one of the harms of the heart CT. The story could have described other harms, such as the implications of false positive or false negative test results. The story adequately quantifies the benefits of Cardiac CT by describing the percentage of patients with blockages that were identified with either the CT scan or the angiogram. The story should have also described the probability of having blockages with a positive scan (positive predictive value). This is the more important piece of information to a consumer. Also not described in the story is whether the CT scans had any impact at all on downstream outcomes, such as heart attacks, deaths, or procedures."""

New Ways to Fight Super Lice,2,"The treatment of childhood cases of head lice infestations is a popular news media perennial at the start of the school year, and this Wall Street Journal story falls into that category. It covers the usual elements — prevalence of the infestations among school age children, over-the-counter and prescription treatments, home remedies (which generally don’t work) and reassurance about the pesky but essentially benign health impact.  This story also takes a look at the rise of “lice-combing” salons and newer medications meant to stand in when older medications are ineffective. We were impressed by the depth of the sourcing, along with the details that helped readers assess any potential conflicts of interest among said sources. One thing we wished had been more detailed: How the evidence stacks up for each of the treatments. As the article itself makes clear, head lice infestation is a widespread, unpleasant, and disruptive — albeit relatively benign — condition that costs millions of families money, aggravation and time in efforts to prevent and treat. Adding to the nuisance of ridding scalps, tresses, clothing and home furnishings of the pests, some of the historic over-the-counter medicinal treatments have lost their power owing to drug-resistant mutations in the lice. Newer prescription medicines are effective, but worry an apparently growing number of parents who work hard to avoid what they consider unnecessary chemical exposure. Thus, parents are certain to be looking for the best and latest information about treatments."

Saving Your Life: Modern Medical Miracles: Matt Lauerâ€™s heart scan,0,"TV anchor Matt Lauer, an asymptomatic 47 year old man with no history of diabetes, with normal blood pressure, borderline high cholesterol, and with a family history of heart disease (his 72 year old father had coronary artery bypass graft surgery) undergoes a heart scan on national TV. We learn that two of his arteries are “pristine” while there is a small “bad” plaque in one artery that could “eventually develop into a problem.” The cardiologist suggests lifestyle modification, baby aspirin, and a statin. There is no independent, second opinion in the story. What have we gained from this experience? Nothing, unless we are GE (parent company of NBC), and manufacturer of the scanning device used in the story. There are many problems with this story. At the end, we are told that this technology should be used only for people experiencing symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, etc. Yet the story featured asymptomatic Matt Lauer modeling the procedure. That is an example of disease-mongering. In the end, the true message of what this technology can and can’t do is completely distorted by the beautiful pictures (3-D rendering of the heart) and empty, non-evidence-based promises. The costs of this technology are ignored. Insurance coverage (an important issue) is downplayed. And the potential harms of having such a scan are not mentioned at all."

The challenges of pinning down the effects of diet are well known (see, for example, a recent article in the New York Times reflecting on these issues) so determining the actual benefits of the Mediterranean diet will take time and careful analysis. This news release is far more convinced of that linkage than is warranted. We assume that diet and exercise help us maintain health and longevity, and we may be right. But determining cause and effect in this arena is elusive. Because cognitive decline and dementia are increasing in prevalence as the population lives longer, any lifestyle measures that delay or mitigate this are important to learn about and implement."

"Lose fat, preserve muscle: Weight training beats cardio for older adults",1,"This news release describes a recent study on the effect different exercises combined with calorie restriction had on older adults. The researchers found that, unsurprisingly, exercise combined with diet was more effective at promoting weight loss than diet alone. The researchers also reported that the type of exercise matters in terms of where the weight loss comes from. They found that seniors who used walking as their exercise were more likely to lose muscle mass, while the weight training seniors lost more weight from fat. This is an important distinction, because muscle mass is important for seniors. Loss of muscle mass, the authors reported, can cause reduced knee strength and contribute to other physical disabilities. However, there is a caveat that wasn’t described in the release. The study’s results apply to seniors with pre-existing mobility limitations and may not be applicable to the general population of seniors. The study was conducted on volunteers who had previously cited a limitation to their mobility. Consequently, their levels of physical activity may have been lower than the average senior at the start of the study and this might lead them to respond more rapidly than someone already in the habit of exercising. For example, when people suddenly pick up weight training they’re more likely to gain muscle (and more quickly) than someone who is already weight training. Our population is rapidly aging, and with it medical costs for the country are rising. Healthy and physically fit seniors require fewer medical interventions and experience a greater quality of life. Exercise can also help aging bones and joints, reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, and enable seniors to live independently for a longer period of time without worrying about accidents or falls. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also says that exercise for seniors can help improve blood pressure, relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression, and control pain from arthritis. This study provides compelling evidence that weight training might be an easy and effective way for seniors to improve their health."

Study says bypass surgery for heart patients better than stents in the long term,1,"""There were enough problems with the execution of this story, which presents results of a study comparing open-heart surgery to angioplasty in patients with serious heart disease, that, in the end, one could question the decision to publish it. The story failed to evaluate the quality of the evidence and to emphasize factors which raise questions about that quality:    The results were reported at a medical meeting and have not been published or peer-reviewed. (See our primer on the potential pitfalls of reporting on such stories.) It was financed by a leading maker of stents. Patients were followed for only one year. The surgery-vs.-stent topic is highly controversial, even emotional, raising questions of benefits, risks, doctors’ self-interest and medical costs – all against a background of contradictory research. Publishing an article on this topic for a mass audience without raising more questions about the quality of the evidence is not in the public interest. Having said all that, the reporter follows many health journalism best practices, including reporting absolute risks, quoting sources with no connection to the research, revealing the study’s funding source and providing context about previous research into stents. Experience suggests that the decision to report a story like this can result when a reporter attends a medical conference and feels obligated to """"come back with something."""" This invites overselling of the story by the reporter or the editor. This tension may be apparent in the lede, which seeks to present a novel viewpoint on the findings. The reporter suggests the findings mean the choice to have surgery or angioplasty """"may come down to one question: How many procedures would you like to have?"""" That’s a spurious question. This research does nothing to change the established considerations that should drive a surgery-vs.-stent decision: Underlying patient health, disease state, death risk, stroke risk, recuperation time, access to a highly skilled surgeon and so on. To imply this potentially life-changing decision should rest on """"how many procedures"""" you want to have is foolish."""

The law requires only licensed dealers - those in the business of selling guns - to conduct background checks on a prospective buyer. As such, only licensed dealers are allowed to contact the state police to request the check. A private seller has no direct access to the background-check process. That doesn’t mean a private seller determined to get a background check is out in the cold. He can ask a gun dealer to conduct the check for him. But that’s a messy process that requires a lot of paperwork and the private seller to temporarily convey his gun to the dealer. So McAuliffe misspeaks when he says the law prohibits the private seller from getting a background check. But the law does make it very difficult for the private seller - who is under no obligation to seek a background check - to get one."""

Stomach stapling may lower cancer risk in women,1,"""This story gets the broad brushstrokes right on a new study about bariatric surgery and cancer: It conveys that women who get bariatric surgery appear to have reduced risk of cancer, while men don’t. It puts the findings in context of previous research. Its greatest strength is the use of two solid quotes, from different sources, indicating that this study leaves a lot of questions unanswered about the obesity-cancer link. Still, the story fails on some very basic practices: It fails to mention the treatment’s costs, harms or alternatives. These could easily have been added; they should be included in nearly every story about the benefits of a medical treatment. An additional shortcoming: It fails to put what appears to be a large percentage risk reduction into terms a reader can understand. A 40 percent reduction in cancer risk is a big deal. A drop in risk in this population from 8 percent to 6 percent–that’s still a big deal, but easier for a reader to understand. The question that leaps to mind for many readers will be: Can a lower cancer risk be a """"tie-breaker"""" for women considering bariatric surgery? It would have been very useful to hear clinicians’ thoughts on that. Which brings us to this:  Take a look at the report on this study that appeared in the Guardian newspaper in the UK, published in partnership with BMJ. It’s a careful, plain-English description of the findings and their implications for the public. It directly addresses that question of applicability. The AP report is 556 words. The Guardian’s is 676. It’s true that the AP story is 18 percent shorter. But it carries an elevated risk of reader misunderstanding. That’s a risk-benefit tradeoff worth pondering."""

And there was no discussion of the costs of the procedure – in this experimental phase – or what it might cost if it became a treatment. The article also could have provided more context about harms, since serious complications, including death are possible.

"C-Sections Are Best With a Little Labor, a Study Says",2,"In this story, we hear about a long-term comparison of three kinds of birth in Scotland: planned C-section, unplanned C-section and vaginal delivery. This enormous observational study included more than 320,000 children, and followed their health for many years. There was a slight increase in risk of Type 1 diabetes between the scheduled and unscheduled C-sections, which the story uses as a window for interviews with experts about speculation on how vaginal birth benefits babies. But the story misses key points about baseline differences in the women giving birth in three ways, which may have impacted the findings. Additionally, the story only discusses the increased risk (from the hazard ratios given) in relative percent increase, not absolute increase. This results in a misleading description of the findings and the size of the risk. Moreover, the study itself carefully warns that the results don’t prove any causation between the style of birth and the risk. Some readers of the story may mistakenly believe that the limited results prove causation. As the story points out, almost one-third of babies born in the United States are born by C-section. This rate is higher than many other countries. Some of those deliveries are determined by medical conditions that require a C-section, and some are more related to the preference of physicians or patients. Women who may be offered an elective c-section may want to participate in the decision more actively and learn more about the benefits and risks, including those raised by this study."

Panel Reasserts Mammogram Advice That Triggered Breast Cancer Debate,2,"The story provides an excellent overview of new recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) on when, and how often, women should receive mammograms to screen for breast cancer. The story discusses the long-running debate over mammogram recommendations, as well as the differing advice that various organizations provide on when women at average risk of breast cancer should begin mammogram screening and how often they should have the tests, though the story would have been stronger if it had explained what “average risk” means (something that a competing Washington Post story on the recommendations explains well). The story also offers a good discussion of issues related to what the USPSTF recommendations may mean for insurance coverage of mammograms, though it does not tell readers how expensive mammograms may be without insurance. Breast cancer screening is a big deal. As the CDC notes, “Not counting some kinds of skin cancer, breast cancer in the United States is the most common cancer in women, no matter your race or ethnicity.” In 2012 alone, 41,150 women died of the disease. Breast cancer also has a profound impact on the economy, with researchers estimating that it costs the U.S. billions of dollars each year. In other words, it affects the health and well-being of millions of patients and their loved ones, as well as having an adverse impact on the economy. News that relates to the early detection and treatment of breast cancer is clearly news worth covering, particularly when it could inform the decision-making of women and health professionals — and have an effect on women’s access to screening."

"For post-op complications, go back to the same hospital: study",0,"This story summarizes an important study whose findings could affect the way rehospitalizations are handled. It suggests that returning to the same hospital where a surgical procedure was performed has tangible clinical benefits for patients. But the story focused on the study’s more sensational number — a 26 percent mortality drop — while making no reference to the more conservative 8 percent figure that emerged after the authors attempted to reduce confounding error. It also missed an opportunity to go further than the study did by providing some estimate — even an imperfect one — of the dollars and lives that might be saved if the study findings were confirmed and the authors’ recommendations were put into practice. Efforts to improve the quality of care provided in the hospital include reducing readmissions. It is known that these are costly and may represent inadequate care during the hospital stay or post-discharge planning. Indeed, Medicare now has penalties for hospitals that have high readmission rates. It is in this context that the current study suggests that when readmissions occur after surgery, whether the readmission occurs in the same hospital or not is associated with the likelihood of dying. The 26% lower death rate reported in the story probably overstates the benefits of returning to the same hospital. That’s because the comparison reflects some level of bias. For example, if the patient is too sick to travel across town to the original hospital, the ambulance may be forced to take that critically ill person to a different hospital — the death isn’t due to the other hospital but to the seriousness of the patient presenting there. Nevertheless, even a small reduction in death rates with readmission to the same hospital — if shown to be real — represents an important finding. The challenge is what policy levers to use to encourage readmissions to the same hospital. This is not necessarily an easy task."

It addressed every one of the criteria that we believe ought to be included in a story on a medical treatment. While presenting the potential for hope, the article was very grounded. It was clear  to indicate that the medication had common side effects that were sufficiently noxious that 20% of the people taking the medication discontinued doing so. It was also apparent from the story that not everyone using the medication was successful at eliminating alcohol consumption. By providing numbers, it was also clear  that the average number of drinks per day was only slightly less for those taking the medication than those taking the placebo. Good job!"
MRIs urged in breast cancer detection,2,"This 5-star story is an example of excellent health journalism. The story provides a thorough review of the pros and cons of MRI breast cancer screening. The reporter cites unbiased sources who provide evidence-based advice. What is particularly noteworthy in this story is the discussion of the value of early screening and treatment, and whether this screening is finding cancer that would cause harm. This is not a concept often found in stories such as this. The story notes annual incidence of breast cancer, as well as the estimated risk of a woman developing breast cancer during her lifetime, depending on whether she is at higher or lower risk of the disease. The story notes who might benefit from the additional screening—i.e. only those women at higher risk–and provides the downside of overzealous screening for breast cancer in lower-risk women. The story does an excellent job detailing the pros and cons of MRI screenings for breast cancers for any woman who is considering this as an adjunct to, or in lieu of mammography. The story lists data that 5 percent to 25 percent of MRI tests (not just those for breast cancer) are wrong, causing psychological distress and unnecessary treatment. The story reviews various methods of screening for breast cancer and notes the follow-up procedures (i.e. biopsies and other surgeries) and the medical decisions that must be made if there is a suspicion of cancer. The story lists the additional cost of this screening and notes that it may not always be covered by insurance. The story also mentions the cost to public health for these expensive diagnostic tools. All in all, an excellent job by a veteran reporter at a top newspaper."

Taking aspirin could increase cancer survival by 20 percent,1,"Aspirin is one of the most well-studied drugs on the planet, in terms of treating headaches, aches, and pains as well as in helping out those who are at risk of heart disease — the biggest killer of people in developed nations. This release promotes a study that looks at the common drug’s effect on the second-biggest killer, which is cancer. The meta-analysis crunched the data of five randomized trials and 42 smaller studies that focused on colorectal, prostate, and breast cancers and — most importantly — the effect of a low-dose aspirin regimen on the survival of those patients, as well as how their cancer spread over a period of about 5 years. The correlation is eyebrow-raising, with a reduction in death and cancer spread in the neighborhood of about 20%. On the downside, this release doesn’t really get into what might be causing this reduction, or even define what “low-dose aspirin” means. It also doesn’t adequately discuss the risks (e.g. bleeding, allergies, and stomach ulcers) and skips over a couple of other basics that would have been helpful to journalists and readers alike. Behind heart disease, cancer is the biggest killer of people in developed nations. Each year the disease kills about 176 in every 100,000 people in the UK, and roughly 171 in every 100,000 people in the US. Any treatment that that can improve survival — especially low-cost, non-invasive methods — deserves attention. Aspirin is one of the best-studied drugs on the planet, and its risks and side effects are as well known as a preventative treatment for people who are at risk of heart disease, or who’ve had strokes or heart attacks before. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been studied for use in the prevention of cancer. The best data exists for low-dose aspirin and colorectal cancer prevention. The US Preventative Task Force released a final recommendation in April 2016 suggesting certain adults (ages 50-59) might reduce their risk of developing both colorectal cancer and cardiovascular disease if they undertake long-term use (10 years) of low-dose aspirin. The current study examines whether aspirin could improve survival among patients who already have cancer. The authors suggest benefit but admit that the data is limited and mainly comes from observational studies."

Drug for Irritable Bowel Achieves Goals in Trial,2,"This New York Times story about an experimental drug for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) satisfied most of our criteria. Its few shortcomings, however, were significant and threw the overall story out of balance. First, the story reported on clinical trial results obtained directly from the manufacturer of the drug being tested prior to peer review or publication in a journal. The story should have cautioned readers about the lack of external scrutiny of the findings or the conflict of interest inherent in such a scenario. The story then compounded this problem by failing to obtain any independent perspective of its own about the research.

Perhaps the biggest limitation of this story is the minimizing of harms from transplantation, which could include risks of surgery and risks of life-long immunosuppresive treatment and/or organ failure. The risks to the donor are particularly minimized, considering a donor is generally a healthy volunteer undergoing a serious medical procedure that is not required to save his or her life. These implications are not even hinted at. Adding to the unbalanced nature of the story is the fact that all sources of information were experts connected to transplants, mostly transplant surgeons involved in swapping.

It would have been better if more details about the impact of these drugs on cardiovascular endpoints, like heart attack, could have been included in addition to impact on blood sugar. One area that could have been improved was harms of treatment. Since the story’s headline claims older drugs are safe, there should have been some data to support this in the story. As it was, only patterns of side effects were reported for various drugs, which doesn’t tell the reader how often these might occur or how serious these might be. Another area that could have been improved was treatment alternatives. Although perhaps not the focus of the study, lifestyle efforts to lower blood sugar are another important treatment step that is not mentioned."

Legs jog mind and body: How exercise can stimulate brain,1,"This is a feel-good health story about a simple, probably harmless therapy that appears to help people manage a debilitating disease with grace. The segment features a researcher and his colleague, as well as a research subject with Parkinson’s disease. The therapy in question requires a bicycle built for two and a willing training partner to nudge their pedal rate a little faster than normal. Before-and-after film shows how this “forced” exercise can dramatically reduce hand tremors. There is no hyping of disease or reeling off of scary statistics. Other treatment options get a brief (though incomplete) mention. Still, despite its charms, it could be better. It doesn’t mention costs, and is short on details when it comes to the quality of the evidence. It entirely overlooks potential harms of the therapy (see “Harms of Treatment”), and fails to adequately quantify the benefit. Sources are skimpy, too."
Genetic testing can help predict likelihood of disease,1,"This newspaper article presents an overview of genetic testing for common diseases, an important development in clinical medicine and one likely to increase rapidly in importance. It does a good job of providing lists and bullet points that help people understand key considerations. But the story falls short of best practices in several important ways. It draws only on professionals who support and provide testing. The result is a falsely rosy picture of the benefits of testing, without corresponding attention to risks. It fails to refer to the well-documented cases of women who may have had prophylactic mastectomy unnecessarily. It fails to put genetic testing in the context of other options–essentially, not getting the tests and using close monitoring with lifestyle changes. It fails to refer to any published research on the risks and benefits–particularly the effect genetic testing has shown on reducing morbidity and mortality. Essentially the article provides a one-sided view of genetic testing, with the addition of some useful consumer information provided by the practitioners themselves. For such an important topic about critical health decisions, readers deserve a well-balanced story."

Study Looks at Deep Brain Stimulation in Bipolar Patients,2,"This solid story on a very small study of deep brain stimulation gives readers a lot of the information they need, but it also likely will lead to some confusion about what the study found. With a little more work clarifying the potential benefits of the treatment and a better discussion of the potential side effects, this story would have provided much more helpful information on a breaking study. Deep brain stimulation has been touted for a number of disorders, including Parkinson’s disease. Because it is expensive and invasive, studies typically only include a few patients at a time, making it difficult to draw broad conclusions from any one study. This story takes the appropriate cautionary tone, giving readers a glimpse of the treatment’s potential while staying well clear of any hype. The treatment of depression and bipolar disorder has improved in the past decades. However despite the relative success of newer medications and a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorders, many patients do not obtain either an improvement in symptoms or have relapses while undergoing treatment. Deep brain stimulation has shown some promise in several studies over the past ten years but the jury is still out on its effectiveness and durability. This study is not a landmark but rather one more piece of information."

New Nuclear-Imaging Tests Show Promise in Locating Cancer,1,"This story summarizes the incremental benefits of two FDA-approved and relatively recent commercially available nuclear imaging tests designed to diagnosis prostate cancer and a rare neuroendocrine tumor earlier and more accurately. The imaging technologies in the piece have been the subject  of recent corporate press releases and FDA announcements, and the article makes the most of the opportunity to fill in useful context about the comparative benefits of tweaked nuclear imaging capabilities vs other screening and diagnostic/prognostic testing. The story focuses mostly on the prostate cancer test, and generally avoids hyperbole and does an overall good job of keeping expectations for the new tests in check. That said, the story would have been strengthened by having a comment from a front-line prostate cancer clinician or general oncologist, especially to weigh in on what the data shows. That’s because the story was lacking in quantitative data from studies demonstrating the tests’ accuracy, benefits and limits. Earlier and better diagnostics for cancer is a holy grail in medicine, and any news about improvements and advances is likely to get attention from the sick and the worried well. Moreover, as with another gender-specific cancer — breast carcinoma — prostate cancer has been the subject and target of hot debates about the benefits and risks of screening, early detection, radical vs limited therapies, fear-mongering and statistical obfuscation. Coverage of research about prostate cancer diagnostics and treatments has been at times as murky, contradictory, controversial and confusing as has been the case with breast cancer. No surprise then that men (and, as one book subtitle put it, “the women who love them,” ) are intensely interested in any news about technologies that can improve their chances of finding and surviving this disease. Journalists and news organizations should feel a special obligation, then, to cover purported advances in prostate cancer screening, prognosis and therapy, but to put substantial amounts of context in their stories."

The story provided factual information about the study. It also indicated that there could be cost savings to the health care system if additional treatment which failed to provide benefit was avoided. However, the story failed to tell readers:  whether both intensities of treatment are in general use and if not, which represented usual care; costs of individual treatment;  anything beyond what appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. There was no evidence of any new interviews or any reporting. That’s not the best form of health care journalism."
"And this would be the first year, if everything holds true, we will spend over $10 billion of our state budget on Medicaid out of the $28 billion budget.",2,"""Rowden was trying to illustrate that Medicaid spending has reached out-of-control levels. According to Greitens' budget recommendations for fiscal year 2018, the budget for Medicaid has gone up over $1 billion in the last three years and now takes up approximately 37 percent of the state budget. Despite the growing concern from Republicans on the cost of Medicaid spending, Greitens has recommended $10.7 billion for the service for fiscal year 2018, an increase of over $500 million from fiscal year 2017. However, it’s important to note that """"we"""" — as in the state of Missouri — don’t directly fund the entire $10 billion. Because of the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage and the Federal Reimbursement Allowance programs, the state only has to spend approximately $1.7 billion of state revenue on Medicaid. So while Medicaid spending will exceed $10 billion of the nearly $28 billion budget, not all of the money is coming directly from the state. Rowden’s statement is accurate but needs clarification."""

Ultrasound found to affect brain development in mice; experts urge limited use,1,"Sonograms are a routine part of monitoring the developing fetus. Until recently, they were only done for medical purposes. However, women can now get songorams in many malls and shopping centers across the US, often in color and 3-D, to keep as mementoes. This story reports on a new study showing that prolonged exposure to ultrasound can damage the growth of nerve cells in mice. Because this study was done in mice (not humans) and the implications of these results are not known, few conclusions can be drawn from these results. This story attempts to explain the controversies, but is flawed in several ways. The story does not adequately describe the harms of ultrasound. The story states that “a small number of nerve cells …. failed to extend correctly.” This is not sufficient information on harms. It is also not clear what “prolonged” use of ultrasound means — are these some special ultrasounds that happen in these consumer-based settings, or is this the kind of exposure that might result from usual medical use? Furthermore, the story also does not adequately describe the design of the study or comment on the strength of the available evidence. By focusing on “disorders thought to be the result of misplacement of cells during their development,” the story engages in disease mongering. By implying that sonograms could lead to disorders such as retardation, epilepsy, autism, and mental illness, the story exaggerates the seriousness of the findings. The story does quote two sources, the lead researcher of the study and the president of an ultrasound association. The story could have quoted additional, independent researchers or clinicians who could have provided some additional perspective."

Inventor says new heart catheter will save lives,0,"We understand that a newspaper would find it interesting to report on the human interest angle of someone who grew up on a pig farm who won an award for his invention and who hopes to hire disabled veterans to work on his invention. But a health story – so categorized by the Chicago Tribune – that includes claims about saving lives, reducing risks to an absolute minimum, and decreasing health care costs – needs to provide some evidence to back up such claims. This story didn’t deliver that evidence. It was an impressive job of cheerleading, though. The compelling human interest angle of the story shouldn’t deceive any reader into thinking that this “breakthrough” approach can do what the story claims it can do. Maybe it can. But we urge journalists to take a more evidence-based approach to such claims – even in a human interest story and certainly in one in the health section. The use of a peripherally-inserted catheter to measure central venous pressures is not new and has been studied for more than a decade (see Crit Care Med 2000 Vol. 28, No. 12). While some would argue that using the arm as an access site is preferable, there are no studies to back up that claim. It might be easier to do and not require the skill level of a neck insertion but the catheter ends up in the same place and shares all of the liabilities of any central venous catheter. (By the way, central venous pressure measurement catheters end up in a blood vessel and not in the heart as described in the story.)"
Surgical procedure urged for atrial fibrillation,1,"This article on catheter ablation, a treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF), is marred by three flaws:   It fails to disclose that Johnson & Johnson, maker of the device being tested, sponsored the study. In fact, nearly all the researchers have deep entanglements with device makers; two of them work for the maker itself. The story fails to point out that the studied participants represent a subset of younger patients who are not representative of typical AF patients. It reports the study’s duration was one year. It was nine months. Having said that, for the most part the story is well-done: It accurately describes the procedure. It portrays the benefits appropriately and indicates potential harms. It notes the need for longer-term studies to ensure the treatment prevents death and strokes over time. The errors in the story do not result in misrepresentation, and readers will take away the fundamentally correct message: When drugs fail to treat atrial fibrillation, ablation works far better at reducing symptoms and AF occurence than a second drug regimen. They may believe incorrectly that the results apply to typical AF patients, who are older. The nine-month vs. one-year mixup seems forgiveable–as merely sloppy or rushed. But without the sponsorship disclosure readers miss any hint of the commercial hustle behind the study and research into similar devices generally. As a matter of fact, that theme would have been nicely enhanced with another detail the story omits: the cost of the device the sponsor sells."

"In Europe it’s fish oil after heart attacks, but not in U.S.",0,"This story did not go far enough to present information on all sides of the fish oil debate; instead, it focused on the availability of one prescription product. Embedded within this story are some concepts that are very important to understanding medical recommendations and health claims. The story states that “The fact that heart patients receive such different treatments in sophisticated hospitals around the world highlights the central role that drug companies play in disseminating medical information, experts said.” Actually,even within the United States, there is great variation in the way that medicine is practiced even among similarly sophisticated hospitals. And while the drug companies may have a role in this, there are a number of other factors (number of specialists in the area, number of hospital beds, where the majority of physicians were trained, etc.) that influence the treatment variation seen. The overall focus of this story is that because fish oil is more often prescribed in Europe than in the United States, that the disease is better treated there than here. The study cited to support the contention that fish oil reduces the number of deaths 3 years after a heart attack involved patients that consumed a Mediterranean diet which differs than typical American fare, and also did not compare the patients taking fish oil to a placebo control. The story credits the salubrious effects for the heart from the Mediterranean diet on its high content of broiled and baked fish, without mentioning the other ways in which the diet differs from standard American fare – also with cardiovascular benefit (e.g., high reliance on monosaturated oil instead of hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated fats). The article contains more enthusiasm for the use of fish oil than examination of the data supports. The story also framed trial results only in relative terms (20% reduction in the number of deaths and 40% reduction in the number of sudden deaths), not in absolute terms. The story mentioned an article which found that only 17% of family physicians surveyed prescribed fish oil. This was defined in the study as advice to eat more fish or more fish oil supplements. However, this story is all about the benefit of taking fish oil supplements, specifically the prescription fish oil FDA approved for the treatment of very high triglyceride levels. Although this story mentioned that doctors might not recommend increased fish oil consumption because doctors think of it as Ã¢â‚¬Å“just a dietary interventionÃ¢â‚¬Â, the above mentioned article found that 99% of physicians surveyed reportedly agreed that nutrition is important in cardiovascular disease prevention. It is also possible that physicians prioritize the dietary recommendations that they make to patients and they may perceive it is more important to talk about other dietary issues rather than fish oil. The story skimmed the surface of some very important issues regarding fish oil and prevention of cardiovascular disease. It could have done much more."

Dabigatran superior to warfarin when anticoagulation is resumed after bleeding,0,"This news release touts an analysis of Medicare data for 1,500 patients who suffered a major bleeding event while taking anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation. Researchers found that patients who resumed anticoagulants after a hemorrhage had better stroke and mortality rates than those who did not, and those who resumed treatment with a newer drug, dabigatran, had fewer recurrent hemorrhages than those who restarted treatment with the old standby warfarin. The news release lays out relative differences in outcomes but doesn’t include absolute risks and benefits that would convey the true significance of these findings. Nor does it mention the wide cost difference between the two drugs or the fact that prescribing patterns at the time the data were collected may have skewed the findings. Bottom line: this is an observational study, not a controlled clinical trial. It is not appropriate to be making recommendations about one drug or another based on such a study. This study sheds light on the dilemma of whether patients at risk for blood clots should resume taking anticoagulants after a major hemorrhage. Less than half of patients who survived a bleeding incident resumed taking anticoagulant drugs, apparently because their doctors perceived a high risk of recurrent bleeding. But the authors say their finding that the risk of stroke outweighs the risk of recurrent bleeding should encourage clinicians to resume anti-clotting drugs. And while the analysis shows better outcomes with a new drug compared with an old one, the authors acknowledge that finding needs to be validated in other patient groups and with more recent data. In an observational study such as this, one must be very cautious with the conclusions."
Terry McAuliffe Says Ken Cuccinelli tried to make it more difficult for mothers to obtain divorces.,1,"McAuliffe’s ad says Cuccinelli introduced legislation in 2008 that would have made it more difficult for mothers to obtain divorces.

The legislation would have allowed the other spouse to block the process by filing a written objection. In portraying the bill as an attack on women, McAuliffe ignores that the legislation would have made it equally more difficult for dads to get divorces. So McAuliffe’s statement has accuracy, but leaves out an important detail and context."

Study: Stomach banding beats drugs in curing diabetes,2,"This was an interesting story reporting on the diabetes improvement that may follow gastric banding surgery. But the story erred in referring to ‘curing’ type II diabetes. The evidence from the paper never mentions cure; it discusses remission, which is not the same thing as cure. It has different meaning for patients too. So we advise against using these words interchangeably. We don’t know if these patients will stay in remission for the rest of their lives. This is only a 2 year study. An important message that should have been reiterated is that the impact of gastric banding surgery to effect diabetes is linked with weight loss. While the surgery may better enable people to engage in lifestyle changes and lose weight, it is certainly not a magic bullet. In the absence of dietary change, meaning reduction in caloric intake, this surgery does not appear to alter diabetes. This is a key piece of information that needs to be included in the messages about the possible benefits of this procedure. Costs should have been discussed in this article, including out of pocket costs. Harms were not discussed."

By critically evaluating the evidence, stories can help consumers focus on the changes that are most likely to be beneficial. We know that people get easily overwhelmed by health claims and end up thinking that much of it is hype and doesn’t matter anyway. If we are cautious about reporting on observational studies, it improves consumer understanding, critical analysis, and credibility of science and of journalism."

New ALS drug Radicava comes with new questions as well,1,"This ABC story undertakes a worthy goal — throwing a dose of reality on a new drug for ALS, Radicava, that’s being billed as the first to be approved in 22 years. This story attempts to ground the glowing headlines by right away focusing on the drug’s high cost, intensiveness of administering, and importantly, to remind readers that this is not a cure. But, the story didn’t explain that this drug was only shown to work in a very specific small subset of ALS patients. The description of this subset of patients is not given, suggesting to readers that this drug could work for any ALS patient, which is misleading. Update: This review prompted us to explore this issue further in a blog post, “Facts about the new ALS drug Radicava that you’re unlikely to see in news stories.”   Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurologic disease in which motor neurons die and result in people losing the ability to speak, eat, move, and breathe. Some 5,000 people are diagnosed each year in the U.S. and average survival is three years. Clearly there’s a need for better treatments — if not a cure, a way to slow down the progression with more oomph that we currently have. The only other FDA-approved drug for ALS is riluzole, which slows progression and can increase survival by 2-3 months. This new drug comes with many limitations, and patients deserve to know all of them."
New Way to Treat Inoperable Lung Cancer,1,"""Lung cancer is a devastating diagnosis. Few tumors are caught early; those that are can be successfully treated with surgery. However, some patients are not eligible for surgery for various reasons. For them, radiation may not cure the cancer but may control it for some time. A new type of radiation, Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) provides targeted, highly-focused radiation treatment to the tumor while leaving the surrounding tissue intact, important for those whose lung function may already be compromised. A small pilot study published in this week’s Journal of the American Medical Association found that SBRT provided improvements in 3-year survival compared to what other studies have shown is achieved with conventional radiation. However, because this was a small, single-institution study with no direct comparison to other treatments, some caution must be taken in interpreting the results. This story could have been improved in the following ways:  By discussing costs – given how experimental the treatment is, insurance may not cover the procedure. By commenting on the quality of the evidence – while the results are compelling and encouraging, this was a small, single-institution, non-controlled trial, meaning there was no comparison made to any other treatments. This makes the interpretation of the results very difficult. By further describing the harms of treatment – the story indicates that 16% experienced significant but non-deadly side effects of treatment. What side effects? How significant? By quoting independent experts – the story does not quote any sources other the lead author of the study. Independent experts could have provided some much-needed perspective on the importance of the new findings. This story narrowly avoids some of the pitfalls of a common scenario in contemporary health care reporting – preliminary results about a potentially better treatment for a bad disease – this time a new form of radiation for lung cancer. The key words here are """"preliminary"""" and """"potentially"""" – the best this article did was insert the tiny word """"may"""" in the first line when referring to the fact that this treatment """"may control"""" this cancer better than currently available treatment. Readers shouldn’t have such a hard time seeing the reality. Without it, one can see desperate patients and families clamouring for insurers or the government to pay for this lifesaving treatment. Only by making the facts clear, not sensationalized, can they see that hope isn’t proof, and that the clamour should be to get the definitive study under way."""

The positioning and facial expressions of the persons in the image suggest that the woman might have been looking beyond the cop to shout at someone or something behind him (outside the right-hand frame of the camera), with the officer in the foreground positioned so as to prevent her from approaching any closer to the object of her ire."

"Erectile dysfunction drugs are safe, possibly beneficial after heart attack",1,"The release summarizes a Swedish study that found men who took erectile dysfunction (ED) drugs following a heart attack had a lower risk of dying or being hospitalized for heart failure than men who did not use these drugs. The release does a good job providing information about this retrospective observational study. The study design, number of subjects and results are provided in a straightforward manner. The release also commented on the limits of observational research and didn’t make cause-and-effects claims such as that the drug “reduces risk.”  The study obtained data on ED drug from national health records data and inclusion for the study was at least a single prescription for the drugs during the study period. How even a single prescription for an ED drug can in some way alter risks is unclear. There is a suggestion that the effect may be dose related but the study itself is silent on the issue. The release did note that the ability and desire to engage in sex may be a marker of reduced risks. The safety of the use of drugs to treat ED in men who have suffered a myocardial infarction (heart attack) has been in question for many years. The risks of administering both a PDE-5 inhibitor such as sildenafil (Viagra) and nitroglycerin (for improving blood flow in heart disease patients) has been a concern. An observational study that suggests that the use of the ED drugs does not add to risk is a welcomed piece of information. The study itself did not claim that ED drugs are associated with reduced risk of subsequent heart attacks. And as noted in the release, the ability and desire to engage in sexual activity may point to enhanced longevity rather than drugs used to treat ED."

There must be a big promotional campaign underway for this device, since the substance of this story – and the timing of it – is very similar to one we reviewed on NBC just a few weeks ago. This is not the way journalism should cover new medical devices. What kind of an environment does such unquestioning storytelling create for public discussion and understanding of medical technology assessment and comparative effectiveness research? Journalism can help the public understand more about scrutinizing evidence, about potential harms and about costs. These factors were sorely missing in this story."

Dose reduction strategy can substantially reduce high cost of TNF inhibitor therapy in RA,1,"This news release lays out in clear, lay language the findings of a study looking into whether reducing the amount of tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) administered to patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diminishes its effectiveness. It goes beyond the study to include quotes from the lead author that do a good job summarizing the work. But while the release touts the possible cost-effectiveness of the reduced-dose strategy, it does not say how much money might be saved if clinicians adopt it, or even provide a ballpark figure for what the drug costs. Perhaps direct costs aren’t as important for patients in Europe, where this release originated, but surely any journalist reporting on the story would want to put a figure on the potential savings — so why not put those numbers in the news release? Cutting the amount of drug used would save money and might reduce the incidence or severity of side effects — both of which would increase value to patients and the health care system."

‘Closed-heart’ a less-invasive alternative,2,"Minimally-invasive surgery, also known as percutaneous surgery, represents an important development in the treatment of aortic valve disease. Aortic valve disease typically occurs in adults over the age of 65 and is a common cause of heart failure. Risk factors include increasing age, obesity, and high blood pressure. Surgery to undergo aortic valve replacement is most often performed via ‘open heart’ surgery, a very invasive procedure in which the patient’s ribs are cracked open to access the heart. In this story, we learn of an experimental minimally-invasive procedure in which artificial valves are moved to the heart using image guidance through an incision in the femoral artery. The prevalence and seriousness of aortic valve disease are accurately described.The story clearly points out that this is a new, experimental procedure that is performed only in the context of research (so far only 19 Americans have undergone the procedure). We also learn that because of the experimental nature of the procedure, it should only be used in those patients who are too sick to endure open heart surgery. The story correctly describes the nature of the existing evidence, with research still in progress; we don’t know if this procedure will extend lives or improve quality of life. The story provides balanced information on harms by presenting the death rates for both the experimental treatment and conventional surgery. By quoting multiple sources, it is clear that the story did not rely solely on a press release for information. No costs are presented. Overall, this was a balanced and complete story."

"To Heal Diabetes, Doctors Push Weight-Loss Surgery",2,"This is an extremely well-done story about bariatric surgery used not to support weight loss in the morbidly obese, but to treat diabetes in people of more moderate weight. The reporter has made good use of the unusually generous amount of space granted by quoting a variety of sources, citing high-quality research and sketching the history and controversy of the surgical application. He also illuminates the financial self-interest that may motivate advocates. The article itself is well-supported by two infographics, and is extended a bit by an entry on the newspaper’s blog featuring an additional interview and some more facts. The story’s one significant shortcoming is its failure to create a point of comparision by describing conventional diabetes treatment in more detail. A less troublesome problem is the anecdote about the surgery patient; it is slightly off-point and potentially confusing. The woman interviewed is a diabetic who qualified for surgery as a weight-loss treatment. Given the context, the remission of her diabetes is assumed to be due to the surgery, when in fact it may have been due to the weight loss. Kudos to this newspaper for affording this topic the space required to present such a balanced story."

Triumph for Drug to Straighten Clenched Fingers,2,"This story is about the long journey to approval of a new drug called Xiaflex used to treat Dupuytren’s contracture–a condition in which cords of collagen cause fingers to clench involuntarily. While the main story focuses mostly on the financial maneuverings related to the drug’s development, this sidebar provides a very informative overview of the drug’s benefits and risks for patients, costs, and effectiveness compared with other treatments. Overall, an excellent effort – markedly different than an earlier story on this drug by ABC News.com. A drug’s approval by the FDA is often accompanied by excessive hype regarding the new therapy’s benefits but little scrutiny of potential downsides. It’s nice to see an approval story that balances excitement about benefits with sober analysis of costs and possible harms. Dupuytren’s contractures can be a debilitating disease that until recently has required surgical interventions. The availability of a new drug treatment is a welcomed addition to the treatment options available to patients with the disorder. The role of Xiaflex as compared to surgery is unclear at the present time."

"Got Night Milk? A Possible Treatment for Anxiety, Insomnia",1,"Starting with the headline of the article, so-called “night milk” (cow’s milk collected at night) is touted as a possible treatment for anxiety and insomnia. This is certainly the type of headline that grabs one’s attention. The claim is difficult to support, however, due to the inherent limitations of the underlying study. The article’s main shortcoming is that it mischaracterizes the quality of evidence presented by the study. Our concern is that the story misreports the comparisons that were made in the study. Contrary to what the article reports, night milk is never directly compared against day milk in the study. Nor is it ever directly compared against diapezam. To its credit, the article does a very good job in correctly recognizing that the underlying study only concerns animals and thus cannot be generalized to humans without further research. The CDC states that, “getting sufficient sleep is not a luxury – it is a necessity – and should be thought of as a ‘vital sign’ of good health.” Further, more than one quarter of Americans claim to not get enough sleep and around 10% suffer from chronic insomnia. The sleep-promoting and anxiety-reducing effects of night milk are worth studying because the findings may suggest its potential as a natural aid for sleep and anxiety related disturbances."
"Tiny implantable device short-circuits hunger pangs, aids weight loss",0,"UW-Madison graduate student Guang Yao (left) and Xudong Wang (right) hold a small implantable device for weight loss This release about an experimental implanted device to promote weight loss tells readers that it has been tested only in rats (though not until the third paragraph), but then it goes on to proclaim that the new device has “several advantages” over an existing FDA-approved device that also works by stimulating the vagus nerve to alter hunger perception, despite the fact that these comparative claims have not been tested. The release implies that the device could help all people who have obesity, without noting that the existing device is restricted to a subset of people. The release makes claims of benefits that have yet to be tested and does not mention harms that similar devices cause. The study was published in Nature Communications. The history of medical research is littered with “successful” animal experiments that failed to produce useful human treatments. While animal experiments that support a novel concept may be of general interest, this experimental device appears to be a refinement of an existing type of device. In this case then, the story is not the underlying concept, but whether this new device is better or worse than the existing one. Until the two are compared directly, no one can say (and news releases should not claim) that they expect a device tested only in some rats will prove to be superior to an approved device or other alternatives. Let’s wait for the evidence."
Sleep’s role in weight loss remains a mystery,1,"The story should have connected its own dots. Why tell us that there’s no evidence supporting sleep interventions for weight loss, and then give us a prescription for sleep changes to help us lose weight? Judging the quality of evidence is critical. But the main reason to do it is to assess the quality of healthcare recommendations derived from that evidence. Obesity is a major public health issue and any weight-loss interventions, particularly inexpensive behavioral ones, are valuable."

Preventive neuroradiology: Brain imaging bolsters efforts to lower Alzheimer's risk,0,"Vague descriptions, sweeping generalizations, overly laudatory quotes — these are some of the things that we think news releases should avoid. But this release includes all three and accordingly received low marks on most of our criteria. What are the major problems? The news release provides no evidence to back up its central claim — that MRI imaging will help convince people to adopt healthier behaviors that reduce Alzheimer’s disease risk. It also provides no meaningful description of the review article that’s the basis for the release, and does not describe the methodology utilized in identifying the studies included in the review. The release also never establishes what exactly is new here that merits attention. And it displays no awareness that overuse of medical technology (including so-called “MRI abuse”) is one of the main drivers of spiraling health care costs. In fact, there is no mention of costs at all in this release. Nearly 44 million people worldwide suffer from Alzheimer’s disease, which is the sixth leading cause of death in the US. Not only that, treatment is expensive: The cost of caring for Alzheimer’s patients in the US is estimated to be $226 billion in 2015, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. Since there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, any measures that could identify and prevent cognitive decline would be beneficial to patients and clinicians. What we don’t need are expensive new tests that will raise the cost of care without any evidence that they improve outcomes."

"Drug Shows Promise in Curbing Compulsive Gambling, Study Says",0,"This story discusses nalmefene, an opioid antagonist, which is a drug that affects the brain’s dopamine system and is thought to reduce the pleasurable sensation associated with addictive behaviors such as compulsive gambling. The drug was FDA approved for the treatment of alcoholism in 1994, but it is still under study for the treatment of other addictions. Nalmefene was tested in a multi-site, randomized, double-blind trial; however, there were only 207 participants, and of these, only 73 actually completed the full 16-week trial. There was no mention of this in the news story, and only brief discussion that a third of the participants dropped out due to nausea and “other side effects”. Other side effects included insomnia and dizziness and were slightly greater in those given a higher dose of nalmefene. Though the study was well-designed, results would not likely be generalizable to a larger population based solely on this small group of compulsive gamblers treated with nalmefene. No quantitative data is provided on the efficacy of the drug, and no information is provided on potential long-term side effects, namely the long-term side effects of this class of drug on the liver. Other opioid antagonist drugs such as naltrexone have shown some toxicity to the liver. Nalmefene does not appear to have the same incidence of toxicity, but long-term safety has not been studied. If this is a pill taken daily, as might be expected in patients with a chronic condition, more long-term data on liver and other toxicities is needed. No information is provided on the cost of the drug. Lastly, the journalist cites the primary author of the study, noting he has “no financial stake in BioTie”, maker of nalmefene, however, two other researchers are employees of BioTie Therapies, and in the disclosure section of the journal article there is a note that the study was supported by BioTie Therapies Corp."

Study: ADHD Diet Helps Reduce Symptoms,0,"Within the body of the story, some nuggets of solid health information can be found, but they can’t outshine all the cheerleading for a diet that may prove, upon much needed further study, to be bad for kids. ADHD affects, by most estimates, 1 out of every 20 kids, and researchers are not certain what causes it or what aggravates it. As the HealthDay story on the same topic pointed out, there is controversy among researchers and clinicians about whether to put children on restrictive diets. Most parents would prefer not to treat their children with medications if possible, so dietary therapies that work are of great interest. This is one of only a few studies to take a randomized, controlled trial approach to studying dietary effects on ADHD, and, according to the Lancet, it is the largest trial to date.

Because it:  was based on a very small, very short-term study didn’t explain the limitations of drawing conclusions from such a study appears to have come directly from a news release without any independent reporting. included no independent perspectives on whether the findings were important or not. doesn’t explain that this study – because of small size and short duration – may not have a meaningful impact on the literature about dietary factors and cancer prevention.

UAB Optometrist Improves Treatment and Care for Patients with Dry Eye,0,"This is a lay-friendly news release touting the benefits of  lifitegrast (marketed as Xiidra), a newly approved prescription drug for the treatment of dry eye. It would have been stronger with some quantified details on the benefits and a better description of the clinical trials the drug’s recent FDA approval is based on. Although this is not the only product available for treatment of dry eye, the news release does not say anything about the others while claiming that this is the first prescription drug for dry eye. And there was no mention of the cost of the product. As a result, a reader does not have enough information to formulate an informed opinion about the product. Though dry eye rarely results in permanent vision loss, it can lead to “pain, ulcers, or scars on the cornea, and some loss of vision,” according to the National Eye Institute. Dry eye can also make it difficult to use a computer or read. Thus, treatments can be key to improving quality of life. The drug’s approval is a significant boon for Shire, the manufacturer. Analysts predict it may become a blockbuster (meaning sales in excess of $1 billion) by 2022. With such a potentially wide customer base, claims about its benefits — particularly in relationship to other available over-the-counter and prescriptions treatment options — should be carefully scrutinized."

New study firmly ties hormone use to breast cancer,2,"""The story does a good job presenting 2002 data from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) on the increased risk of developing breast cancer with prolonged use of HRT (also termed estrogen plus progestin treatment). However, the story does not accurately report the results of the recent JAMA paper:   Even women who took estrogen and progestin pills for as little as a couple of years had a greater chance of getting [all types of] cancer."""" There is nothing in this study to contradict the earlier WHI report showing that breast cancer risks start to diverge after about 4 years , not """"a couple of years"""". This article reports on all cancers, not just breast. Nowhere in the JAMA article are all cancers plotted over time to support the assertion of a couple of years. Followed by the assertion that """"…these new findings are likely to end any doubt that the risks outweigh the benefits,"""" this creates the inaccurate impression that there are new data showing breast cancer risks start earlier on in the course of treatment. A second inaccuracy concerns the statements about the size of the observed risk of breast cancer: """"At the peak, the breast cancer risk for pill takers was twice that of the others."""" Not accurate: the hazard ratio was 1.26, indicating a 26% higher breast cancer risk, not 100% higher (which would be twice the risk). Finally, a main point of the article–that cancer risk [presumably all cancer, not just breast] returns to normal roughly 2 years after quitting — is not supported by the study results. JAMA article states """"The HR for overall risk of all malignancies increased from 1.03…to 1.24…in the postintervention period."""" And, """"…a downward inflection in the temporal trend in cumulative HRs for breast cancer was observed over time (not shown) but the observed change…is not statistically significant."""" Despite the misplaced emphasis in the story compared with the source article, public health and cancer specialists put the results of the study in context and reassure women that their risk profile might be different if they are younger or older (women in the study were in their 60’s, typically after menopause is complete). The story lists HRT as one option for treating very bothersome menopausal symptoms; however, HRT should be used judiciously and only for a short time. There are also other options for managing hot flashes and bothersome menopausal symptoms, which the story does not mention. But for some women, low-dose HRT may still be the most appropriate treatment. Women who are considering this choice need accurate information to weigh the risks and benefits of HRT, and the story appropriately provides absolute and relative risks of taking HRT for the short and long-term (5 1/2 years). The story gives number of cases of breast cancer per 1000 women for those who took hormone therapy v. non-users. Lastly, the story does not address the cost of estrogen plus progestin treatment, nor the costs added or saved due to complications of or benefits from that therapy. However, the story advocates for selective use of low-dose HRT."""

Fighting spinal pain with a titanium ‘bullet’,0,"This story reports on a new implantable device, the X-Stop prosthesis, that was recently FDA approved for people with spinal stenosis. The story does mention surgery and steroid injections as the alternatives, but fails to mention other conservative treatments, including physical therapy, weight loss, or oral anti-inflammatory medication. The representation of the prevalence and seriousness of spinal stenosis is also questionable. Although approximately 500,000 Americans over age 50 may be experiencing symptoms, it is not clear that they have the formal diagnosis of spinal stenosis. Although there is mention of a trial, there is no description of the study design or duration of follow-up, an important consideration in chronic relapsing conditions like back pain. In fact, this was a single study with a relatively small sample size in which one or more authors received sponsorship from the device manufacturer. More importantly, however, was the use of a questionable control group. The control group in this study was comprised of a mixture of non-operative treatments, including bed rest, lumbar supports, and injections (of variable amounts). Also, no direct comparison was made between the device and laminectomy (the appropriate control group). All of these factors limit the readerâ€™s ability to evaluate the evidence behind the device. Furthermore, no quantitative estimates of benefit are provided and the story downplays the harms of the device. The story should have mentioned that in the study, 17% of the patients in the device group experienced some adverse event and 10% required some sort of re-operation. Although the story mentions the cost of the device, we have no other costs to compare it to. Finally, only a single source is quoted and we can’t be sure of his potential conflicts of interest. The reader should expect the journalist to assess the quality and strength of the evidence supporting a new device. Highlighting a single success story and a single surgeon’s enthusiasm may obscure the truth about the nature of the evidence. It may be that this ‘bullet’ is indeed an important innovation, but the reader is not provided with enough balanced information to come to that conclusion."
Nucleix Announces Positive Clinical Results for Lung EpiCheck in Early Detection of Lung Cancer,0,"This release describes a preliminary study of a new proposed blood test for lung cancer that’s going to be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting. The release frames the test as a potentially useful screening tool for detecting cancer in people who seem otherwise healthy. However, that’s not the population that the researchers studied and reported on — the study results came from individuals known to have (or not have) cancer. The test’s ability to correctly identify cancer in a seemingly healthy population whose cancer status is unknown is an entirely different matter — and one that must be assessed in subsequent studies to determine how useful the test may or may not be for screening. Other concerns include the lack of cost information and no mention of the harms from possible false positives or negatives. While the release seems more targeted to potential investors than the general public we still encourage releases to include relevant information on benefits, potential harms and clear descriptions of the evidence. Lung cancer can be a vicious disease and many advanced cancer patients are given a poor prognosis. Part of the challenge of improving outcomes is earlier detection, so a potential blood test that could screen for the disease would be advantageous. But this work is very preliminary and its difficult to assess its potential value. Readers, particularly lung cancer patients and their families, may derive false hopes from the way the test is pitched in the release."

The reporter explores the question of clinical application with four independent sources, which permits a reader to understand more fully how and under what circumstances the drug might be used. The report would have been stronger if the differences in symptoms between the drug group and the placebo group had been detailed. Stroke symptoms can be mild or debilitating, and it’s not clear exactly how much practical benefit the treatment provides. The report is particularly strong at the top: the author properly uses the word """"intriguing"""" when the study is first mentioned, which keeps expectations in check.

Antibodies seen stopping Alzheimer’s,2,"The story accurately reports that while intravenous immunoglobin therapy (IVIg) has been used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, it is not yet FDA approved for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The story appropriately cites researchers not affiliated with the clinical trials who express caution about off-label use until there is more data on the safety and efficacy of this treatment for Alzheimerâ€™s patients. The story provides no quantitative evidence from this pilot trial of IVIg therapy in 8 Alzheimerâ€™s patients. We are not told very much about these patientsâ€™ cognitive improvement from baseline to the end of the 18-month trial. Additionally, the results described here were presented at a conference and have also not been peer-reviewed in a medical journal. The story does note that larger controlled trials are necessary to further investigate antibody therapy for Alzheimerâ€™s. Adverse reactions within this small trial are not provided. IVIg is a human blood product that comes from multiple donors, and while it is screened for HIV and Hepatitis B and C, there is still a very small risk of contracting these infections via IVIg therapy. The most common complications of IVIg therapy include headache, skin reactions, nausea and fatigue during and shortly after an infusion. More serious allergic reactions can also occur with IVIg therapy, but the story does not mention any side effects of this treatment. The story provides the estimated cost of treatment for IVIg therapy for Alzheimerâ€™s patients; however, we are not told if more than one dose is required. The story acknowledges that Baxter International, Inc., a producer of IVIg, is funding early trials of this treatment. While the story does not overtly engage in disease mongering, it should make clearer to the reader that the connection between diabetes and Alzheimerâ€™s is not yet proven. There may be a link between insulin resistance, inflammation and the development of Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes may subdue brain inflammation contributing to Alzheimerâ€™s disease."

Gene therapy helps boys with 'Lorenzo's Oil' disease,2,"This story is one of two that we are reviewing (the other is from the New York Times) that focuses on a recent paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine. At issue is a novel gene therapy used to limit or eliminate symptoms related to the disease adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). The AP story does a good job of making clear that the treatment is not yet available for widespread clinical use and does a fair job of describing the study and its results. However, the story appears to mischaracterize current treatment options for the disease, and overlooked the potential harms. Left untreated, ALD often leads to death within 1-10 years of diagnosis. And there are precious few treatment options available. What’s more, the primary treatment, bone marrow transplantation, relies on the availability of a donor — and poses significant health risks of its own. All this makes new treatment options incredibly important for ALD patients and their loved ones. However, the fact that we are talking about the life and well-being of patients — usually children — also makes it incredibly important to place the work in context. Limitations, availability and unanswered questions are always key points worth making, and especially so when many parents are eager for information about something that may affect the health and well-being of their children. The story does a decent job here. But the story also appears to provide an unnecessarily limited view of potential treatment options. ALD is already a daunting diagnosis with limited treatment options available. Characterizing those options as being even more limited than they already are is problematic."

Brain’s Electrical Activity May Help Spot Infants at High Risk for Autism,0,"This story, though, did a particularly poor job in large part because it allowed the lead author of the study to promote the idea that this might lead to a scan to be used on all children. The story did this despite the fact that it did very little to evaluate the quality of the evidence behind the study, presented no quantification of the potential harms associated with screening and tossed aside the issue of cost by claiming that scans — even for every kid in the country — would be “relatively inexpensive”. Autism spectrum disorders are increasingly being diagnosed, yet the causes remain elusive and the treatments are far from a cure for most kids. Parents are hungry for solutions. Early detection for autism spectrum disorders is felt to be important because early interventions are one of the few treatments that are effective. Moving the window for detection from age 3 or older, when many of the behaviors develop, to the infant stage could provide additional time for early intervention strategies. The fact that the story does not talk about what these might be for infants is one of many missing elements that made this story a missed opportunity."

Medical Breakthrough: Amazing New Heart Valve Procedure,0,"""Open heart valve replacement is a major procedure, involving risks and a long recovery period.

However, this story makes it sound as if this new procedure is a fait-accompli. Referring to it as """"groundbreaking"""" and """"the biggest thing since the heart transplant"""" imply that all patients who are candidates for this procedure should run out and get it. This story provides little in the way of real information to patients or family members who would be seriously considering valve replacement. It quotes no sources other than doctors at Columbia who have an interest in how this procedure is evaluated.

New Ways to Detect Ovarian Cancer,0,"""Ovarian cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to find and treat early. There are many reasons for this, including the fact that there are no good screening tests and that the symptoms are vague and easily attributed to other causes. This story reports on new recommendations being issued by a group of cancer advocates to make women aware of the symptoms and urge them to get treatment if these symptoms come on suddenly and persist for two weeks or more. This story does accurately describe the symptoms and explains why this may be important, but does very little to actually inform the viewer. The story does not comment on the strength of the available evidence to support whether early intervention in women with this combination of symptoms results in better outcomes. The story does not comment on potential harms of the recommendations. The story should have discussed the very high numbers of women who will have these symptoms but not have ovarian cancer. Given that these symptoms are very vague, this is a big concern. The story continually refers to the combination of symptoms as if it is truly """"new"""" information. The truth is, these symptoms have been known for a long time. What is novel is that advocacy groups have formalized recommendations on evaluating women with these symptoms and seemed to have organized a campaign to raise awareness.

Penn research: An FDA-approved Alzheimer's drug could help smokers quit,2,"This news release describes a report on an ongoing trial of the Alzheimer’s drug galantamine as a smoking cessation aid. The release also notes that the study on which it’s based sought to explore whether the drug would have less of an effect on participants’ “executive functions” while going through withdrawal than other methods since many people in the process of giving up tobacco experience forgetfulness and “fuzziness,” according to the release. The release does a good overall job of describing the researchers’ long-range thinking and goals with the study, and the release is clear that this approach could have downsides and side effects. The release would have been stronger had it talked about about costs and discussed how this approach compares with the alternatives. Simply stated, cigarette smoking has been found to have ill effects on almost every organ of the body. Despite decades of research and laws banning cigarette advertising people still have a hard time giving up this habit. Few people who try to quit are successful on the first try, and it’s not uncommon for people to try several different methods before they can quit for good. This study focuses on one of numerous clinical trials that explore interfering with the brain’s response-reward systems as a way to combat addiction. Re-purposing Alzheimer’s disease drugs as a potential new tool in the smoking cessation tool chest is newsworthy."

One-day fight against herpes,1,"This story reports on the recent FDA approval of a one-day dose of an antiviral medication, Famvir, for herpes. The story clearly states that this is a new formulation of an existing drug. The story states that the FDA recently approved the new dosing regimen. By accurately describing the prevalence of herpes simplex virus or HSV, the story avoids disease mongering. However, the story should have mentioned what percentage of HSV infections are symptomatic and the comments about HSV and pregnancy need a bit more explanation. Because the story quotes multiple sources, the reader can safely assume that the story did not rely on a press release as the sole source of information. The story provides some quantification of benefits of treatment, but they are presented in relative terms only. The story states that the drug “shortened outbreaks by about two days.” Was it from 3 to 1 or 20 to 18? The reader should be provided more context for these numbers. Although the story mentions other antiviral medications, including the topical ointment and daily pills, as the alternative to the one-day dosing of Famvir, the story should have further described the advantages and disadvantages of this new approach compared to the existing ones. The story also confused the treatment of existing outbreaks with preventing outbreaks.

Study finds rise in choice of double mastectomies,2,"This article reports findings from a paper published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology that demonstrate a rise in double mastectomies among women diagnosed with cancer in one breast. This may be overtreatment for many women. The story may have been more balanced by interviewing a patient who chose less treatment and her rationale for this choice. The story cites breast cancer experts who note that there is little difference between the surgical treatments in terms of dying from breast cancer. Importantly, the story notes that having a mastectomy does not reduce a recurrence risk to zero, as some cancer cells may remain. The story notes that physicians should provide women with as much information about the survival benefit of all treatments, including less invasive options for reducing the risk of a recurrence. The story lists other non-surgical options for prevention and active surveillance for women at high risk of or having a recurrence, or developing a primary breast cancer. An important oversight of the story is the lack of discussion of radiation, which is often given with lumpectomy. Lumpectomy alone is not comparable to mastectomy without radiation. The story might have benefited from listing data comparing lumpectomy and radiation with mastectomy. On this point, foregoing radiation due to another health condition and/or preferences to avoid side effects may play into a woman’s decision to undergo a mastectomy or bilateral mastectomy. The story also didn’t mentioned that some reconstruction procedures (e.g. tram flaps) can only be done once, so women considering those may have double and do both at once."

Quality of Life Found Equal With 2 Breast Cancer Drugs,1,"This story follows up on earlier reports released by the National Cancer Institute announcing results of the STAR breast cancer prevention trial, which compared tamoxifen with raloxifene in women at higher-than-average risk. Initial reports from NCI suggested that while the two drugs were equally good at lowering breast cancer risk, raloxifene offered an advantage because it caused fewer blood clots and uterine cancers. With the release of the peer-reviewed results in the Journal of the American Medical Association, raloxifene still appears to be clearly better. It was just as good at preventing invasive breast cancer, and had a lower risk of blood clots and perhaps also of uterine cancer. The article incorrectly states that the difference in the number of blood clots was not statistically significant. In fact, that difference was significant. On the other hand, the difference in the number of uterine cancers was not. For readers who may not know what it means when a difference is or is not “statistically significant,” the story could have noted that although there were fewer uterine cancers among women who took raloxifene than among those who took tamoxifen, the difference was small enough that it could have happened just by chance. That means that the risk of uterine cancer might be about the same with the 2 drugs. The article seems to approach disease mongering (in the sense of exaggerating the risk of disease) by implying that any woman with an increased breast cancer risk would be foolish not to choose one or the other of these treatments. Some balance is provided by the comment that some patient advocates question whether women should take a drug to lower their risk. By focusing primarily on the debate about which drug has the more favorable side effect and quality of life profile, the story may have missed an opportunity to draw attention to another issue–what women themselves think about taking a drug that has a relatively small chance of offering any individual woman a real benefit. NOTE: this review does not address the portions of this article that related to the cervical cancer vaccine."
Mounting evidence demonstrates improved cognitive function from cocoa flavanol consumption,1,"This content-light release has a lot of persuasive power. For an eight-week, 90-person study, it makes some overly broad claims. Reporters should be wary. The danger is that a vague release like this will be simplified to a misleading message such as, “To improve memory, consider chocolate.” CBC News has a terrific story about why that irresistible message is not accurate. The cocoa drink studied here isn’t chocolate at all, and it’s certainly far from what you’d find in a packet of Swiss Miss. And though we gave the release partial credit for mentioning in an editor’s note that this product isn’t commercially available, we think that caveat buried at the end will likely get lost in a lot of news coverage. It certainly did in this story based on the release that claims, “Chocolate may be good for your brain.”"
Active Surveillance Preserves Quality of Life for Prostate Cancer Patients,2,"A Vanderbilt University news release about an important study on prostate cancer treatments and quality of life left us disappointed: Why so few specifics on the measured benefits? In this 3-year study of more than 2,500 men with prostate cancer, researchers compared how these patients rated their quality of life after treatment by surgery, radiation or active surveillance. The study found that patients who chose active surveillance reported fewer side effects, but the release disappoints with a lack of numbers and precision. The release does not even tell us the number of participants in the study. Since this is a very timely study about a widely discussed topic, we wish the release had provided numbers and context. An estimated 250,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in the United States each year, according to the National Cancer Institute, and about 80 percent of those cancers are localized — meaning the disease has not spread from the organ. These patients deserve clear information on the risks to their quality of life from surgery and radiation, as well as potential benefits. The emotional impact of a cancer diagnosis was not examined in this study. Previous research has suggested that emotional distress is an important predictor of men opting for surgery after receiving a prostate cancer diagnosis. Because of the length of the study, the risk of death from prostate cancer following any treatment can not be concluded. As the release notes, that will require studies lasting 10 years or more. Both individual patients and society-at-large have a lot to gain or lose from the way prostate cancer is treated, as discussed in this Journal of the National Cancer Institute economic analysis."

The concept that a survival advantage has not been demonstrated is mentioned only briefly at the end and is not given adequate coverage. Harms of screening are also not mentioned. The story presents a very rosy picture of screening and doesn't mention that screening can also lead to unnecessary treatment (like surgery) in some whose cancers may never have caused harm. While the story does disclose that its parent company makes CT scans, there is no independent comment on the study findings, or indeed, no balancing perspective included about why lung cancer screening may not be a good idea just yet."""

Demonstrating far more balance than some other stories, this report allowed the chair of the US Preventive Services Task Force to explain their recommendations:  “The task force did not say don’t get mammograms, Moyer said. “It might make women not want to get the test,” she said. “This is a decision that should belong to the woman with appropriate info on hand.”  But still missing in the piece was any recognition of the possibility that a decline in mammography in women in their 40s could be a good thing."

Mixed Result in Treating Schizophrenia Pre-Diagnosis,1,"This story discusses a randomized, double-blind trial of Zyprexa for the prevention or delay of schizophrenia in high-risk young adults experiencing early symptoms of psychosis (schizophrenia is a more severe, chronic psychotic disorder). Due to potentially serious side effects, Zyprexa and similar anti-psychotic drugs are not currently FDA approved for prevention of schizophrenia in patients identified at high-risk of developing this psychotic disorder. The story mentions that this was a small clinical trial and the idea of identifying patients at high-risk of developing a psychotic disorder and treating them with a drug like Zyprexa is still new and has several risks, with very limited long-term benefit. There is no mention of other treatment options for patients who show signs of psychosis or who go on to develop schizophrenia. The story mentions some of the harms of treatment with Zyprexa seen in this short-term trial, but there is no mention of the long-term side effects or safety of taking this medication. Diabetes and complications of the metabolic syndrome have been noted in many patients taking newer anti-psychotic medications, including Zyprexa. This may be a result of the significant weight gain from the drugs. The FDA has issued an additional warning hypoglycemia and diabetes as a result of taking Zyprexa: http://www.fda.gov/medwaTCH/SAFETY/2004/zyprexa.htm  The story lists the limited benefit of taking Zyprexa to delay psychosis after one year of treatment, but this difference was only marginally statistically significant. The story does not mention that after the medication was stopped, these patients showed more severe psychotic symptoms than when they were first recruited for the study, suggesting that while symptoms were blunted, the disorder had progressed despite anti-psychotic medication. Additionally, many of the patients did not complete the study, so from the 60 initially recruited, only 12 completed the full 2-year trial. Results from such a small number of patients would not be generalizable to a larger population of patients at high risk of developing a psychotic disorder. There is no mention of the cost of Zyprexa and no mention of how long this medication would need to be taken to prevent a severe psychotic break in susceptible young adults. There is appropriate discussion that Zyprexa is made by Eli Lilly and that the study was partly funded by this manufacturer and the National Institute of Mental Health. Sources other than the study authors are cited and provide some perspective on the treatment and outcome of the trial."

"Walking Fends Off Disability, And It's Not Too Late To Start",2,"This story focuses on a study showing that elderly persons recovering from a disability get back to normal 25 percent sooner if they participate in a program of physical activity including “150 minutes of aerobic activity as well as strength, flexibility and balance training” per week. It points out that “walking was the cornerstone of the program.” While it described the program in helpful terms, the story was light on the study’s specific findings, and seemed to assume that all people in this age group would see comparable results. Also, we would have been more satisfied if the story had mentioned early on that people in this age group should consult with their physicians before undertaking any kind of exercise program. The story points out that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that “just 28 percent of those 75 and up meet the recommendation for aerobic activity, and only 8 percent also did the suggested amount of strength training.”  It says that too many of the elderly are sedentary, believing they’ve earned a focus on relaxation. But this and many other studies outline numerous health benefits from exercise and physical activity, even among the elderly, assuming their physical status is up for it. Physicians should help their patients decide what kind of physical program they should undertake, and as the story shows, even regular walking can be very helpful."

Teen Feels 'Hopeful' After Experimental Stem Cell Procedure on Damaged Heart,0,"This is a story about one young man receiving an experimental infusion of stem cells into his heart, to help with tissue scarring due to muscular dystrophy. Despite booming research around potential stem cell treatments for a wide range of conditions, the list of diseases for which stem cell therapy has been shown to be effective remains very short, according to the International Society for Stem Cell Research. Yet media outlets often put an optimistic spin on unproven stem cell therapies, as we’ve seen in our examinations of stories on heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe combined immunodeficiency, and multiple sclerosis. Showcasing a few preliminary cases with encouraging outcomes can exaggerate the potential benefits of a treatment and raise false hopes for patients. This story, based on a single case with an unknown outcome, fits this pattern. It fails to counter rosy statements by a physician and a patient with realistic assessments of the potential benefits and pitfalls of an unproven procedure for a fatal disease with no known cure. The story also lacks clinical details that would help readers get a true picture of the nature of the treatment, as well as a discussion of costs. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a heartbreaking disease that affects an estimated 1 in 3,600 boys as well as some girls. The most common inherited pediatric muscle disorder, it’s caused by a shortage of a protein called dystrophin, which leads to progressive muscle weakness. Most patients lose their ability to walk by age 12, and average life expectancy is about 25. Often patients die of heart failure because dystrophin deficiency leads to cardiomyopathy, a weakness of the heart muscle that makes the heart less able to pump blood and maintain a regular rhythm. A recent review of current therapies states that “only steroids have been shown to produce a slowing in the declining course of the disease.” Recent research has focused on using stem cells and gene therapy to create new, healthy muscle cells and thus halt or reverse the disease. The rapid advance and certain fatality of Duchenne muscular dystrophy has patients and their families desperate for new treatment options. Reporters have an obligation to those families to present stories in a reasonable and responsible fashion."

Surgeon’s trial study on cancer is hailed,1,"This was an interesting story about an early trial to treat glioblastoma. It reported on partial results of a study. But it let the principal investigator get away with declining to reveal all of the survival data because he wanted to wait until he presented the data at a cancer meeting. Even when he presents the data at that meeting, it will not have been peer-reviewed and it would be difficult for others to comment in-depth about the results. This is one of the weaknesses of stories that try to get a jump on reporting research results. Indeed, the story contained only the perspectives of two clinicians involved in the study. No independent perspective was included. We commend the story for at least referring to the potential bias of one of the sources. The story did not really provide a clear picture about the usual course of the disease. It also did not adequately detail what lies behind the end point of time to cancer recurrence. In addition, although the story mentioned that the people who received the experimental approach were ‘cherry-picked’, it failed to point out that one can’t conclude that the approach had an effect because the outcomes for those in the study were compared to historical controls which would have included a broader range of disease than those in the ‘cherry-picked’ group. The optimism, therefore, may be misplaced. The grateful patient’s perspective may not be representative and her health status at this time cannot be clearly linked to the experimental approach. The story did not provide adequate information about risks and benefits. Cost information was also lacking. And while it was timely to mention Senator Kennedy’s recent diagnosis, the story exhibited one of the flaws in reporting on the illness of well-known people when you don’t have first-hand knowledge of the situation. The story said that “Kennedy’s tumor is thought to be inoperable.”  Perhaps so. But today Kennedy had surgery, which may be followed by radiation and chemotherapy."

Study shows diet and weight may affect response to bipolar disorder treatment,1,"There are several red flags for readers to be aware of in trying to understand this unpublished study (presented as a conference poster) looking into possible dietary influences on bipolar disorder. Mainly, this is a very small study, of limited duration, in which supportive data are not provided, and some key study design limitations are not discussed. On a very positive note, the news release does a good job of making it clear the results need to be validated before dietary advice can be incorporated into the treatment of bipolar illness. This news release serves as a good reminder that:   Exploring dietary treatments for any kind of illness holds great appeal for many reasons, not the least of which is —  if proven effective —  it could give patients a greater role in participating in their own care. Avoiding drug approaches also has many potential benefits. But these studies are very often observational, making it hard to prove a cause-and-effect relationship between certain foods and targeted health outcomes. This release does an exemplary job of using cautious language and providing important context from an independent source, a practice we’ve recently encouraged EurekAlert! and other wire services to adopt."
Diabetes care during pregnancy reduces risk of obese children,2,"The Cleveland paper published a shortened version of a story originally reported by the Associated Press. The story describes results from a large study that suggest treatment of maternal high blood sugars in pregnancy may lower risk of overweight or obese children at age 5 or 7. The story does give absolute benefits (proportions of children who are overweight or obese), does obtain a quote from a source apparently not affiliated with the research, does describe treament options, and does discuss what’s new about this study (e.g. women who have blood sugar, but not necessarily high enough for a diagnosis of gestational diabetes may benefit from diabetes treatment in pregnancy). What’s missing is a description of the strength of the evidence–it’s not clear whether this is from a randomized trial, which is the gold standard–or from some other less robust study design. Because of this, readers don’t know how to gauge the new findings. Another missing element is failure to note that women were classified as receiving treatment if their test results placed them in the category that would have been routine for intervention to be provided. Whether and what intervention women received is not addressed and this weakness is important. There is also no mention of costs of treatment for what would be a new group of people being treated and there is no discussion of risks of treatment, which in this case, could include severe episodes of low blood sugar, particularly for those on insulin."
Surgery improves survival rates for men with prostate cancer if radiation treatments fail,0,"This news release from the University of Missouri Medical School summarizes an observational study of 364 men with re-occurring prostate cancer after radiation who had a complex surgery involving complete removal of their prostate and surrounding tissue. The news release noted that the majority of men were still alive 10 and 20 years after the surgery, called “salvage” prostatectomy. We found this news release missed some criteria we find important such as cost and harms. It reported that surgery-after-radiation increased a man’s chances of survival but the news release provides no support for that claim–and neither does the study. In addition, we looked for data on cancer-specific survival, which presumably is the point of providing a second cancer treatment, but found none. Men with prostate cancer face a bewildering range of choices in treatment, and not much clear advice on the best course. Medicine has not discovered a foolproof way to predict whether a man’s cancer is mild, moderate or aggressive. This new study suggests that some patients who avoid surgery and choose radiation first but then suffer a recurrence of cancer may benefit from salvage prostatectomy after radiation."

"An email comparison living on a             cruise ship with living in a retirement facility has circulated on             the Internet for quite a while. It was mostly speculative and humorous. Then versions started circulating saying that the writer had             actually met someone on a cruise who was living aboard the ship and             paying for repeated cruises instead of living on land. We’ve not found the source of the original email or anybody who has             actually had the experience stumbling across a retired person who             has elected to live as a cruse ship passenger because it was cheaper             than living on land. The idea, however, is not complete fiction. Two experts on elder care from the Northwestern University School of             Medicine have evaluated the idea and their thoughts were published             in the November issue of the Journal of the American Geriatrics             Society.

She’s been doing that ever since, even after the Queen Elizabeth 2             stopped doing trans-Atlantic crossings and operating only in Europe.

I also noticed that all the staff, ships officers, waiters,         busboys,         etc., all seemed very familiar with this lady. I asked our waiter whom         the         lady was expecting to be told she owned the line, but he said he only         knew         that she had been on board for the last four cruises, back to back. As we left the dining room one evening I caught her         eye and stopped to         say hello. We chatted and I said, “I understand you’ve been on this         ship         for the last four cruises”. She replied, “Yes, that’s         true.” I stated, “I         don’t understand?” She replied without a pause, “It’s cheaper than a         nursing home”. Here’s the proof — when I get old and feeble, I am         going to get on a         Princess Cruise Ship. The average cost for a nursing home is $200 per day. I         have checked on         reservations at Princess and I can get a long term discount and senior         discount price of $135 per day. That leaves $65 a day for: 1. Gratuities which will only be $10 per day. 2. I will have as many as 10 meals a day if I can         waddle to the         restaurant, or I can have room service (which means I can have breakfast         in bed         every day of the week). 3. Princess has as many as three swimming pools, a         workout room, free         washers and dryers, and shows every night. 4. They have free toothpaste and razors, and free soap         and shampoo. 5. They will even treat you like a customer, not a         patient. An extra $5         worth of tips will have the entire staff scrambling to help you. 6. I will get to meet new people every 7 or 14 days. 7. TV broken? Light bulb need changing? Need to have         the mattress         replaced? No Problem! They will fix everything and apologize for your         inconvenience. 8. Clean sheets and towels every day, and you don’t         even have to ask for them. 9. If you fall in the nursing home and break a hip you         are on Medicare. If you fall and break a hip on the Princess ship they will upgrade you         to a         suite for the rest of your life. Now hold on for the best! Do you want to see South         America, the Panama         Canal, Tahiti, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, or name where you want to         go? Princess will have a ship ready to go. So don’t look for me in a nursing         home, just call shore to ship. P. S. And don’t forget, when you die, they just dump         you over the side at         no charge. Comments",-1,mixture

Encouraging news about reversing heart disease,0,"This is an enthusiastic story about the results of the ASTEROID Trial, which showed that very high doses of Crestor (a statin) caused regression of atherosclerosis as shown on intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in high risk patients. The story did not make clear that, while these results are intriguing, it is not clear that they will have any clinically meaningful impact on real cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart attack or death, compared to current practice. In fact, the story almost seems to makes leaps beyond what the evidence showed when it said, The study was not big enough to detect changes in the numbers of heart attacks or strokes but evidence suggests that eliminating plaque should lower the risk. There is no explanation of the availability of Crestor. Is it FDA approved? Is it on the market? The story can’t assume that everyone knows. The story also does not place the treatment within the context of other existing therapies. This is important given that the study did not compare the treatment to current practice – regular doses of statins. Although the story is based on trial results, so little information about the design of the trial is presented that the viewer has no basis on which to interpret the strength of the evidence. No harms or side effects are mentioned, which are likely to be significant given the high dose of the drug. No costs are mentioned and only a single source, the study’s lead author, is quoted. The lack of balanced information in this short story makes it very difficult for the viewer to be able to interpret the study results."

"Regular painkillers work as well as opioids for sprains, strains and fractures",1,"The news story reports on the findings of a recent study published in JAMA, which evaluated the effectiveness of four painkillers in addressing acute arm or leg pain in emergency room patients. One of the painkillers was a combination of the over-the-counter medications acetaminophen and ibuprofen; the other three painkillers were combinations of acetaminophen and an opioid (oxycodone, hydrocodone or codeine). The study found that — within the two-hour window being evaluated — there was no statistical significant difference in the effectiveness of the four drugs, indicating that acetaminophen/ibuprofen is a viable alternative to opioids for addressing acute pain. The story is exceptionally concise — a news brief rather than a feature — but does a good job of describing the study and placing it in the context of the “opioid crisis” in the U.S. But much like a related news release, which we also reviewed, the story fails to place the findings in context with previous research on the relative efficacy of opioid and non-opioid painkillers. The story does a lot of things well, particularly given its brevity. It describes the study well and makes clear that the study is important because of the ongoing opioid crisis in the United States. As we noted when reviewing a news release on this study, the American Society of Addiction Medicine reports that at least 2 million Americans had an addiction to prescription painkillers in 2015 — and more than 20,000 people died from prescription painkiller overdoses in the same year. And data from the National Institute of Drug Abuse show that this problem is on the rise. However, any story about research findings will be stronger if it explains how new findings are consistent with or differ from previous research in the field. That may be especially true here. If this story aimed to highlight the finding that non-opioid painkillers are comparable in effectiveness to opioid painkillers, it could have mentioned any of several studies (cited in the journal article) that had similar findings in post-surgical settings."

Patients kept in the hospital under observation will not be able to receive Medicare reimbursements for follow-up care such as nursing-home stays, however. Even more inaccurate is the charge that this policy stemmed from the Affordable Care Act. In reality, this stems from a separate policy decision and had nothing to do with Obama’s law. The claim is not only ridiculous but also dangerous, by urging ailing patients to leave the hospital for no good reason."""
More Than 22% of Heart-Device Implantations Aren’t In Line With Guidelines,1,"This blog post about a study revealing some new data about the overuse of heart implants does some things quite well, but it falls short on a number of our measures. See the Los Angeles Times piece which we also reviewed for comparison. While The WSJ blog includes cost information, which is too often missed in stories, it does not provide enough hard data on the risks or benefits of heart implants. It also should have done a better job evaluating the evidence in this study but, instead, left reviewers – and, we bet, readers – confused. When a study this large finds that 1 out of every 5 people may have unnecessarily undergone a surgery that led to longer hospital stays in, in a minority, a shorter life, that’s big news. Reporters need to make sure that they give readers the proper context to process findings this dramatic. Identifying the best candidates for ICD pacement is not an exact science. Guidelines have been developed to help clinicians and patients determine the best course of action. The guidelines are, at best, interpretations of existing information generated in clinical trials. While useful, they are by no means exact. The study in question examined data collected from a national registry on over 100,000 patients and concluded that 1/5th of the implants were outside existing guidelines. While the findings in the study are troubling at face value, the story appears to be a bit more complicated. The accompanying editorial places the results in a slightly different perspective. Of the four criteria examined, only one (placement of the ICD in patients with severe heart failure) is an absolute. The other three criteria are related purely to timing and not to whether the device is of value. Heart failure patients need the tools to help them ask their doctors the right questions. This story did not provide them enough of those tools."

"""I helped write"""" the Affordable Care Act.""",0,"""Sanders said he """"helped write"""" the Affordable Care Act. He deserves credit for one provision of it -- worth a not-insignificant $11 billion. But overall, he was hardly an inside crafter of the bill. Until his effort was blocked by a GOP procedural move, Sanders supported a more aggressive single-payer system, and multiple news articles quoted him as being undecided about supporting the main Democratic bill until late in the process. Sanders’ statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. UPDATE, March 28, 2016: After we published our story, Sanders’ staff provided PolitiFact with several additional examples of provisions the senator helped insert into the Affordable Care Act, sometimes with the cooperation of other lawmakers. According to his staff, these include $1.5 billion in mandatory spending for the National Health Service Corps, a negotiated rule-making process to redefine the criteria for designating medically underserved areas, a waiver for states that want to experiment on health care policy, a provision to double penalties for health care fraud, a provision strengthening the False Claims Act, language to make volunteer ambulance personnel and firefighters who perform emergency medical services eligible for grants and loans, a provision to ease payments to alternative medicine practitioners, higher funding levels for the Public Health and Prevention Fund, and a formula increase in Medicaid funding that benefited his home state of Vermont. While this list does provide a more detailed picture of Sanders’ role in the bill’s crafting, none of these provisions involve core elements of the law, such as the exchanges and subsidies, the individual and employer mandates, the Medicaid expansion, the tax changes, the essential benefits package, and the provisions on cost containment. We stand by our original conclusion that, despite making contributions to the final legislation, Sanders was, for most of the process, an outsider pushing for a more aggressive single-payer system rather than an insider negotiating and crafting the final design of the bill. While saying that he """"helped write"""" the Affordable Care Act contains an element of truth, Sanders ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."""

Marijuana Chemical Shows Promise for Hard-to-Treat Epilepsy in Kids,2,"Efficacy and safety studies of a marijuana-derived oil on children for whom existing drugs fail to control epileptic seizures support moving cannabidiol into clinical studies. That’s good news. Less cheery is encountering stories about the effects of this drug before it has been tested in placebo-controlled, blinded research venues — or even before the research has undergone peer review. The story in this case makes the shortcomings of the evidence a prominent point in the coverage and we applaud this careful approach. But whether desperate parents will heed that signal is another matter. A source notes in the story that a “major” clinical trial’s results will become available early in 2016. Might the more responsible path have been for journalism to bide its time as well? When a child suffers, little else matters. Parents of epileptic kids whose seizures are not responsive to anti-seizure medicines will be on the lookout for alternatives. Some have apparently already begun to treat their children with marijuana-derived oils similar to that being examined in these studies. Learning as much as possible—as soon as possible—about these chemicals is, consequently, important."

The potential benefits of zolendric acid are important and could point to a new treatment strategy that is more effective and has fewer side effects than current options. This article communicates information about ongoing investigation of the use of zolendric acid at a high level. However, the story is brief – 405 words – and omits key details and facts about the drug and ongoing research that are needed to provide the reader a complete and informed story. It would be useful to the reader to present some of the downsides of treatment, including a potentially long and costly duration of treatment.

The story did an exemplary job of tempering positive spin from the get-go, with cautions in the headline and lead about the financial interests at stake, past failures of Alzheimer’s treatments, and need for more data. It also alluded to the huge potential market for any drug that could arrest or cure Alzheimer’s. Business stories about unproven treatments must explain the news driving investors without creating false hopes for patients. That can be a tall order.

(In fact, we’ve been criticized by various USA Today staffers in the past for missing sidebars entirely when we do our reviews. Online, at least, we think that’s sometimes an easy miss.) But here’s why that’s troubling in this case. The main text focuses almost exclusively on the """"breakthrough"""" nature of the findings and speculates about how the new drug being studied might be used with other therapies to offer """"rare hope"""" to patients with advanced melanoma. Critical details and caveats, however, are relegated to the """"Questions and Answers"""" sidebar.

Acupuncture May Be Effective Painkiller in the ER,0,"This HealthDay story explains the findings from what it describes as the “the world’s largest randomized, controlled trial of acupuncture in the emergency department.” More than 500 patients were seen in four major hospital emergency departments for acute lower back pain, migraine headaches or ankle sprains. For pain control, they received either conventional painkiller drugs, acupuncture or a combination of the two. The story states that the acupuncture was proven as safe and effective as other treatments. Yet, as the study abstract states, “none of the examined therapies provided optimal acute analgesia.” That point didn’t make it into this story, which relied heavily on the news release. For another in-depth take on this story and the news coverage, see “A skeptical look at a study of acupuncture delivered in emergency rooms.”   Given the growing trend in overdosing and dependency with the use of opiate painkilling medications, any effective alternative will be a welcome addition to public health care. Some patients cannot use some conventional analgesic medications and having an alternative therapy when needed would certainly be an improvement. But the story fails to give readers any insight into whether they might expect acupuncture as a possible alternate therapy when they visit the hospital’s emergency department."

Association of radiation therapy plus lumpectomy in reduced risk of dying in women with DCIS,1,"This news release summarizes an association study comparing 140,000 women with a diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) who received three different treatments. The study utilized the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database to evaluate outcomes. DCIS is a noninvasive form of breast cancer, sometimes referred to as stage 0 breast cancer. There is debate as to whether it should be called cancer at all. The study reported outcomes in three groups of patients:  1) patients who underwent lumpectomy (surgery to remove the tumor) plus radiation versus lumpectomy alone; 2) patients who underwent lumpectomy without radiation versus mastectomy (surgery to remove the breast); and 3) patients who underwent lumpectomy plus radiation versus mastectomy. Women who received radiation had a slightly lower (0.27% reduction) risk of death from breast cancer at 15 years compared to women with lumpectomy alone. The release mentions some limitations of the research but missing is a broader discussion of the potential for over treatment of DCIS, whether DCIS needs to be treated at all, and whether women with low-risk forms of the disease can be safely monitored without treatment. We’ve written about this previously. Over treatment is a widely discussed issue in many areas of cancer, including DCIS, a noninvasive early form of breast cancer that some physicians believe should not be strictly labeled “cancer,” primarily when it’s low grade, or grade 1 DCIS. Exposing women to radiation in addition to lumpectomy has the potential for unnecessary harms. This brief release does not provide that context. The published study itself includes this comment: “It is doubtful whether a benefit of this size is large enough to warrant radiotherapy.”"

Phase 3 analyses in Alzheimer's show clinical benefit of tramiprosate in APOE4 carriers,1,"This news release from a public relations firm on behalf of drug manufacturer, Alzheon, describes an experimental compound tramiprosate that showed some impact on patients carrying the APOE4 gene which is present in many people who go on to develop Alzheimer’s disease. The drug is thought to target amyloid — protein fragments that aggregate abnormally in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s. But the dense technical language of the release prevents most readers from understanding the scale of the improvement reported in patient thinking or behavior during this study. The major drawback of the release is that it didn’t talk about limitations of the sub-group analysis. While exploratory, this sub-group analysis cannot lead one to draw any conclusions about whether the drug “worked,” given that the overall study was negative. The release also did not help readers understand when the drug would be prescribed, in relation to diagnosis, if the drug is approved. Estimates are that more than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s disease, a progressive and disabling neurological disorder. This release about a drug that might slow decline or ease symptoms is disappointing. It claims the drug works, but doesn’t make it clear for readers just how well. We aren’t given context for understanding the numbers that are shared. Many caregivers are suffering emotionally and financially by the burdens of caring for a patient with this disease and eager to hear any good news about therapy. Bottom line: This release on an experimental drug treatment trial for Alzheimer’s disease focused on a small sub-group analysis from which conclusions can’t be drawn."

"Short Mental Workouts May Slow Decline of Aging Minds, Study Finds",0,"""This is a story about one of the few long term studies looking at the potential for cognitive training to alter the rate of cognitive decline with aging. It describes results from a second report from the ACTIVE (Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly) study. For the lay reader, the report falls short in several places. Most importantly, the article hypes the problem of Alzheimer's, dementia and similar disorders, when the study is about cognitive decline in normal aging. Second, there was very little in the way of reporting on specific results and it was not clear from the story what were the specific findings of the actual study. The missing context that could have easily been provided (along with other information about preventive options) would have greatly strengthened the study. Although the ACTIVE study is commendable, it has certain limitations that were acknowledged. The participants in this study had a mean education level of 13+ years of schooling, in a population with an average age of 73. For example –  will the results obtained in this group with relatively high levels of education translate to people with lower levels of education? The story included several misleading statements about the study. The story mentioned staving off mental decline in middle-aged and elderly people whereas the study only included people who were 65 years of age or older to start, with an average age at the start of 73. Thus they could hardly be considered middle-aged. The story reported that the results of the study would be analogous to finding that """"if someone went to the gym Monday through Friday for the first two weeks of the new year, did no exercise for five years, and still saw significant physical benefits in 2012."""" This analogy does not hold up – first, because the study included booster sessions in intervening years and, secondly, because it would be expected that individuals who had received training would make use of what they had learned in the time between studies. Finally, it is very difficult to interpret the results reported in the story, understand what they mean and see how they derived from the study. For example – the story reported that """"those that got the speed training did 300 percent better than the control group."""" What exactly was it that the speed trained people were 300% better at? This is explained in the study, but not in the story. Readers need this information in order to weigh the potential benefits of the intervention."""

But after a reporting change July 24, 2020, they now report all negative results as soon as they’re known. Outside Dane County, these delays wouldn’t have had much effect on the more trusted seven and 14-day rolling averages of how many tests were positive. And percent positive is just one of several key indicators that guide local decision-making — the others weren’t affected by the backlogs."
Video games improve brain connections in multiple sclerosis patients,1,"This release describes a comparative study in a very small number of patients with MS who either used a video game program or not. The research study reports that the control group received no comparative treatment during the 8-week study period. The study reports changes in brain imaging and test scores that suggest benefit at the end of the study period. While encouraging, the release alludes to the need for considerable additional studies. We found that the release ignored some criteria we consider important, including cost, harms, alternative therapies and acknowledgement of the study funders or any potential conflict of interest. It would have been helpful for the release to emphasize more clearly what this study doesn’t do and next steps needed before this is something that patients with MS, who may be desperate for new therapies, should embrace. MS is a degenerative brain disease that often affects individuals in the prime of life. For some, the course may be mild and managed with current therapy. However, for others it is a terrifying disease with rapid declines in function that can come without warning and only partially be reversed with treatment. In this context, therapies that help “train” the brain to function better within the limits of the disease make sense. And there are a range of rehabilitative programs that are available to MS patients and it is in this context that any new treatments, such as video game training should be considered. If proven effective, this approach of using a home-based, readily available video game/training program might improve the quality of life for MS patients whose prospects for improvement are often slim. However, the size of the study population is far too small to extrapolate findings to MS patients overall, and neither the release nor the study itself demonstrate an actual clinical improvement in these patients, although the lead paragraph of the release suggests that such is the case."

Animal study suggests treatment that may improve heart function in heart failure,2,"This release focuses on a recently-published study in rats with high blood pressure that are at risk of heart failure, a condition in which the heart does not pump blood as efficiently as it should. The study’s findings suggest treating the animals with a low dose of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) improved cardiac health in the rats. Specifically, the study focused on diastolic heart failure, in which the left ventricle of the heart does not fill with blood properly, limiting the amount of blood pumped through the body with each heartbeat. The release mentions right in the headline that the study involved animals, and it does a good job of highlighting that much work needs to be done before the work done in rats may lead to clinical use in humans. The release could have done a better job describing the known risks associated with this hormone and describing the benefits observed in the study. Heart failure is a big deal. According to the CDC, more than 5 million people in the United States are diagnosed with heart failure and — in 2009 — heart failure was a contributing factor in one out of every nine deaths in the U.S. The CDC also notes that heart failure costs the U.S. an estimated $32 billion each year in missed work and treatment costs. Because of its prevalence, health impact and economic impact, any new advances in treatment that could ameliorate health risks associated with heart failure are certainly of interest."
Study Raises Questions About Stents in Some Heart Patients,2,"This Wall Street Journal story describes surprising news that a very common procedure– inserting a stent to open a blocked blood vessel — does not add benefit over medication in patients with angina. Angina is chest pain due to blocked heart arteries, and is common among people with heart disease. One strength of the story is the detailed description of the study itself and in finding outside sources to critique aspects of the study. We do think the cost of the procedure was worth discussion, as well as the potential harms, but they were not addressed in this story. These points were raised in the New York Times story, which we also reviewed. Heart disease is still the leading killer of Americans so any news about treating aspects of heart disease, such as blocked arteries, is newsworthy. In addition, this story suggests that stenting — common, but expensive — is a prime example of over-treatment."

Stent procedure reduces stay to repair aneurysm,0,"This is an unbalanced story on the supposed benefits of the use of a stent to repair an aortic aneurysm. The risk of an untreated aneurysm which the reader is told “can burst, causing severe back pain and often death within minutes” is not contrasted with the risks of having had an aneurysm treated. There was no mention of the potential harms of using a stent. There was also no mention of costs. The only framework for the story is provided by a single source â€“ a local surgeon who performs the procedure. The story needed at least one other independent source. The patient who was profiled is said to be an individual in his 80s and in poor health. The evidence to support the statement that the procedure “saved his life” is unclear. It is also worth noting that most aortic aneurysms are abdominal and screening for them is not only considered ineffective, but the best therapy is unclear."

Blueberry concentrate improves brain function in older people,0,"Following a very small study of 26 people, scientists at the University of Exeter claimed that drinking about two tablespoons of blueberry juice concentrate improved the brain function of 12 adults, partially based on  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) function tests. The study lasted only 12 weeks. The news release exaggerates the importance of such a brief limited study, and it doesn’t include any numbers that would help readers  understand any changes that were observed. On the plus side, the release does disclose that the study received financial support and samples from a blueberry supplement manufacturer. The volume of nutrition advice hitting the daily news cycle is overwhelming readers’ capacity to keep up and sort the evidence-based news from the purely promotional. News releases like this tend to straddle both the good and the bad. While fruits and vegetables are uniformly considered healthful, this claim of brain changes from a few tablespoons of blueberry concentrate is backed by very thin “evidence” from a very preliminary and limited study. We wish the release had explained the limitations of small, short duration studies. We’ve seen this before and described some of the problems in a blog post on why readers need to be skeptical about nutrition claims relating to brain health — and how you can’t eat your away out of dementia risk. Moreover, these sorts of releases and news stories further perpetuate the notion that supplements provide remarkable and clinically meaningful health benefits despite the fact that with almost no exceptions, the research has not borne this hope out."

Panel nixes aspirin as cancer preventive,0,"The story describes a new recommendation from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advising that aspirin and other similar drugs not be taken for prevention of colon cancer in people at average risk. The story does appropriately describe the natural history or disease burden of colon cancer without obvious embellishments or overstatements, but many other criteria were not met. Areas that were lacking included: a discussion of the actual evidence on which the recommendation is based, quantification of the potential benefits, a description of how frequent or severe harms might be, a source that was clearly independent of the study or panel, and a description of alternate colon cancer prevention approaches, like screening and follow-up of any abnormal screening results, particularly given the fact that the story is about a potential prevention approach that is now not advised. So what else is there? Readers are not given much context here."

Patients with drug-resistant malaria cured by plant therapy developed at WPI,1,"In an African health clinic, 18 patients who did not respond to conventional malaria therapy received tablets made from dried leaves artemisia annua (DLA). The patients, who were described as near death, all recovered according to a case report from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The news release on this case series is short on typical medical measurements, and we wish it had included details on how long the patients were followed. Did their “cures” remain for months or years? We also wonder if there is any financial benefit to the university or researchers if the new therapy were adopted. The release does not explain. Finding a low-cost way to truly cure patients with malaria would be a stunning development that could save 429,000 deaths per year worldwide, according to the World Health Organization estimates. But this single report from a clinic about 18 patients is not enough to trumpet a cure, and we wish the release had taken more care to provide additional caveats. If this drug is used as the first line treatment, it is very likely that the parasite would eventually become resistant to the drug."
